,,,Multimedia in Political Science: Sobering Lessons from a Teaching Experiment.,"College students learn something about American government when taught using multimedia techniques, but it is not clear what that is. I report a controlled experiment to test the effectiveness of a multimedia method of instruction in political science against two alternative methods. The findings based from this particular experiment raise some questions about designing multimedia applications to achieve pedagogical objectives. Given the considerable costs associated with multimedia applications, educators should evaluate their use compared with alternative methods of teaching. It is not enough to rely on students' statements that they enjoyed viewing videos. 341 ""Multimedia"" is the current buzzword in educational technology. It refers to combining different electronic media, commonly computers and videodiscs, in teaching materials. Computer vendors present dazzling images of multimedia applications in classrooms, and many teachers view multimedia as the way to reach today's generation of TV-oriented students. Unfortunately, the road of good intentions in educational technology is strewn with failed efforts. One pioneer of computer applications to teaching in the 1960s became so disheartened by the lack of progress by the end of the decade that he wrote a critical essay, Run, Computer, Run: TheMythology ofEducationalInnovation (Oettinger, 1969). It criticized his earlier optimism and raised questions about the future of computers in transforming education in America. Of course, computingthen consisted ofmainframes and terminals, but the record of personal computers in education is also problematic today. Although a study by Sheingold and Hadley (1990) found hundreds of teachers in elementary and high school who used computers effectively, another researcher said that such imaginative usage is ""extremely rare"" (Becker, quoted in Chira, 1990, p. B6). Evaluating computing in the curriculum at a large midwesternstate university, Glick argued that ""the impact of computers on the educational process on our campus and others like it is marginal at best"" (Glick, 1990, p. 35). Perhaps multimedia, by relying on students' demonstrated fondness of television, offers a more robust technology that produces positive results more readily.

,,,Student involvement: A developmental theory for higher education.,"Even a casual reading of the extensive literature on student development in higher education can create confusion and perplexity.

Experiential Learning as Instructional Design We would add to this basic model the proposal that certain activities support different phases of this cycle. By con structing learning sequences that lead students through the full cycle, an in structor should be able to foster a more complete learning than can be gained from a single perspective. Figure 2 lists learning activities representative of each of the four poles of the learning cycle. For example, field experiences, inquiry laboratories, direct data collection, and the reading of primary sources such as poetry are all designed to give the learner firsthand, personal experiences with the content. Activities such as discussion and journal keeping force students to re flect on their experiences and the experi ences of others. Model building exer cises, research papers, or lectures that present a model foster abstract concep tualization. Simulations and projects force students to apply the models to problem situations. Thus to produce a complete cycle, the instructor would select an activity from each pole and guide the students through them in order. For example, a unit de signed for political science, which fo cuses on age variables related to political attitudes, might begin with field work. Students could conduct interviews with people of different age groups (concrete experience). Each student could catego rize his or her own observations (reflec tive observation) and make initial specu lations on differences between the ages represented. Next the class as a whole could pool their results and identify common age patterns to generate a model (abstract conceptualization) that describes how different age groups are likely to react to other political ques tions. Finally, the class could test their hypotheses by follow-up interviews with other members of the same age groups (active experimentation).

A specific activity, such as viewing a film, may fit into more than one cate gory depending upon the instructional intent.

10.1187/cbe.04-07-0050,15592590.0,,Approaches to Biology Teaching and Learning: Learning Styles and the Problem of Instructional Selection—Engaging All Students in Science Courses,"Teachers aspire to have all of their students learn. This aspiration of reaching all students spans disciplines, age levels, and all varieties of institutions. Most teachers do so out of a genuine love for their discipline and a desire to share the wonder of their chosen field with others. Science teaching is no different than other disciplines in this respect. However, try as we may in science, the lack of diversity apparent in the statistics of who chooses to pursue scientific disciplines professionally suggests that we still have much to learn about how to reach all students. In their book, Talking About Leaving: Why Undergraduates Leave the Sciences, Elaine Seymour and Nancy Hewitt (1997) provide ample evidence from analysis of previous studies and their own research that two major factors contribute to choices students make about pursuing science majors and their satisfaction with science as a choice of major—classroom climate and faculty pedagogy. These factors underlie many of the reasons ‘‘switchers’’ leave science majors and many of the complaints ‘‘nonswitchers’’ have about their education in science (Seymour, 1997). Competitive class climate, strict grading, overpacked curricula, and the overt ‘‘weed-out’’ attitude of some faculty are cited most often as criticisms and reasons for abandoning a science major. However, Seymour and Hewitt (1994) emphasize that ‘‘switchers’’ and ‘‘nonswitchers’’ are not identifiably different populations of students, in that academic ability is not a reliable predictor of who stays and who leaves. This leads to the conclusion that science classroom environments, instructor teaching styles, and the process of instructional selection is unintentionally causing the loss of able, interested students from the profession of science. If we lose students precisely because they learn differently and think differently than those who currently dominate the profession and teach them, we lose a potential source of future creativity in our discipline. Sheila Tobias (1990), author of They’re Not Dumb, They’re Different, writes that ‘‘not every student who doesn’t do science can’t do science; many simply choose not to.’’ Tobias identifies the selection process of introductory science courses as a driving force against diversifying participation, and thus diversifying intellectual approaches within the profession. Consider the environment that characterizes most science classrooms, particularly in the late 1980s when Sheila Tobias conducted her research in these classrooms. It is usually organized by an individual—faculty or a teacher of grades 6 through 12—who survived, if not thrived, in the fairly traditional pedagogical settings of teacher-centered direct instruction, mostly dominated by lecture-based approaches to teaching. The dominance of lectures and direct instruction, especially at the high school and undergraduate level, in an attempt to transmit the large body of accrued scientific knowledge efficiently, has created a relative monoculture of teaching styles in these settings. Although a variety of strategies have been developed to broaden access for students through more varied instructional strategies (see, e.g., Allen and Tanner, 2003; Tanner et al., 2003), these approaches are not widely used for a variety of reasons. This is not to say that lectures have no place in the pedagogical toolbox of a science instructor, but rather that this tool tends to be overused (Powell, 2003). As such, teaching strategies used in science classrooms have created a situation that we’ll refer to here as Instructional Selection, in which by our very choice of pedagogy, we are constructing environments in which only a subset of learners can succeed. Understanding the variety of learning styles that students bring to a science classroom will not only help some students learn more science, but also help more students learn any science.","Kimberly D.

Although a variety of strategies have been developed to broaden access for students through more varied instructional strategies (see, e.g., Allen and Tanner, 2003; Tanner et al., 2003), these approaches are not widely used for a variety of reasons. This is not to say that lectures have no place in the pedagogical toolbox of a science instructor, but rather that this tool tends to be overused (Powell, 2003). As such, teaching strategies used in science classrooms have created a situation that we’ll refer to here as Instructional Selection, in which by our very choice of pedagogy, we are constructing environments in which only a subset of learners can succeed. Understanding the variety of learning styles that students bring to a science classroom will not only help some students learn more science, but also help more students learn any science."," Teachers aspire to have all of their students learn. This aspiration of reaching all students spans disciplines, age levels, and all varieties of institutions . Lack of diversity apparent in statistics of who chooses to pursue scientific disciplines professionally suggests that we still have much to learn about how to reach all students ."

There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed.

Methods We administered the ILS, LSI and CSA to family medicine and internal medicine residents and Year 1 and 3 medical students and applied the multitrait−multimethod matrix to evaluate convergence and discrimination. After 3 months participants repeated the ILS and completed the LSTI.



Results A total of 89 residents and medical students participated.

Given the almost unlimited variety of job descriptions within food science and engineering, it is safe to say that students with every possible learning style have the potential to succeed as food scientists and engineers. They may not be equally likely to succeed in school, however, since they respond differently to different instructional approaches and the predominant mode of instruction favors some learning styles over others. The goals of the study were to test the degree to which student performance and attitudes were consistent with expectations based on learning style theory and prior studies. The Index of Learning Styles© (ILS) was administered to several groups of undergraduate and graduate food science and engineering students taking different courses at the Universidad de las Americas, Puebla. Those courses were taught in a manner that emphasized active and cooperative learning as well as inductive presentation of course material. Visual, sensing, and active learning styles were displayed by the majority of students. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between males and females for the Sensing/Intuiting and Sequential/ Global dimensions of the Felder-Silverman model. Type differences in various academic performance measures and attitudes were noted as students progressed through the curriculum.

Factor analysis of PEPS and SPQ data obtained from 400 Australian university students indicates that these two instruments measure two quite distinct conceptualisations of how students learn and that it is therefore appropriate to differentiate between the way students learn in terms of either style-based or approach-based constructs. Test-retest reliability of the PEPS and SPQ produced from correlational analysis of data collected from two administrations of these instruments, a year apart, shows that approach to learning is relatively stable over time but that learning style, as measured by the PEPS, is not as stable a construct as its authors claim.

Learning styles and teaching styles in EFL,"Learning styles are a student's “natural, habitual and preferred ways” of absorbing and processing a second language. This study investigated Reid's (1987) hypothesis that a mismatch between teaching and learning styles causes learning failure, frustration and demotivation. Data were collected through Reid's questionnaire, interviews and tests using 206 EFL students and 46 EFL teachers at a Hong Kong university. It was found that learners favoured Kinesthetic and Auditory and disfavoured Individual and Group styles,while teachers favoured Kinesthetic, Group and Auditory styles and disfavoured Tactile and Individual styles; Western teachers also disfavoured Auditory styles. There was therefore a mismatch regarding Group and Auditory styles. Interviews revealed that 72% of the students were frustrated by a mismatch between teaching and learning styles; 76% said it affected their learning, often seriously; and 81% of the teachers agreed with Reid's hypothesis. The correlations between learning style, proficiency and discipline were also checked. Learners who favoured Group styles were significantly less proficient. Conclusions are that EFL teachers should teach in a balanced style in order to accommodate different learning styles.","Matthew Peacock,Matthew Peacock",International Journal of Applied Linguistics,2001.0,"Learning styles are a student's “natural, habitual and preferred ways” of absorbing and processing a second language.

Because patients with MCI often progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the VPC may be useful in predicting the onset of AD. VPC uses noninvasive eye tracking to identify how subjects view novel and repeated visual stimuli. Healthy control subjects demonstrate memory for the repeated stimuli by spending more time looking at the novel images, i.e., novelty preference. Here, we report an application of machine learning methods from computer science to improve the accuracy of detecting MCI by modeling eye movement characteris- tics such as fixations, saccades, and re-fixations during the VPC task. These characteristics are represented as features provided to automatic classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using the SVM classification algorithm, in tandem with modeling the patterns of fixations, saccade orientation, and regression patterns, our algorithm was able to automatically distinguish age-matched normal control subjects from MCI subjects with 87% accuracy, 97% sensitivity and 77% specificity, compared to the best available classification performance of 67% accuracy, 60% sensitivity, and 73% specificity when using only the novelty preference information.

Then, several studies of highly motivating computer games are described. These studies focus on what makes the games fun, not on what makes them educational. Finally, with this background, a rudimentary theory of intrinsically motivating instruction is developed, based on three categories: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity.

Challenge is hypothesized to depend on goals with uncertain outcomes. Several ways of making outcomes uncertain are discussed, including variable difficulty level, multiple level goals, hidden information, and randomness. Fantasy is claimed to have both cognitive and emotional advantages in designing instructional environments. A distinction is made between extrinsic fantasies that depend only weakly on the skill used in a game, and intrinsic fantasies that are intimately related to the use of the skill. Curiosity is separated into sensory and cognitive components, and it is suggested that cognitive curiosity can be aroused by making learners believe their knowledge structures are incomplete, inconsistent, or unparsimonious.","Thomas W.

These propositions have important implications for human development and those responsible for it. A research programme to generate evidence of work‐based coping behaviour among managers with which to assess the validity of the first three of these propositions is reported. Three versions of the LSI were administered (standard, elaborated and randomised) on a test‐retest basis to a sample of adult participants in courses in management studies at Sunderland Polytechnic, and 130 usable results were obtained.

In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed. ≈ 2000 Academic Press To be motivated means to be moved to do something. A person who feels no impetus or inspiration to act is thus characterized as unmotivated, whereas someone who is energized or activated toward an end is considered motivated. Most everyone who works or plays with others is, accordingly, concerned with motivation, facing the question of how much motivation those others, or oneself, has for a task, and practitioners of all types face the perennial task of fostering more versus less motivation in those around them. Most theories of motivation reflect these concerns by viewing motivation as a unitary phenomenon, one that varies from very little motivation to act to a great deal of it. Yet, even brief reflection suggests that motivation is hardly a unitary phenomenon. People have not only different amounts, but also different kinds of motivation. That is, they vary not only in level of motivation (i.e., how much motivation), but also in the orientation of that motivation (i.e., what type of motivation). Orientation of motivation concerns the underlying attitudes and goals that give rise to action—that is, it concerns the why of actions.

The VARK measures four perceptual preferences: visual (V), aural (A), read/write (R), and kinesthetic (K). VARK questions can be viewed as testlets because respondents can select multiple items within a question. The correlations between items within testlets are a type of method effect. Four multitrait—multimethod confirmatory factor analysis models were compared to evaluate the dimensionality of the VARK. The correlated trait—correlated method model had the best fit to the VARK scores. The estimated reliability coefficients were adequate. The study found preliminary support for the validity of the VARK scores.

In that sense we propose a mixed approach. Firstly, we collect explicit information about the students by means of the ILS (Index of Learning Styles) questionnaire developed by Felder and Soloman. Our system adapts the course structure and sequencing to the student’s profile. Later, we use the implicit information gathered by the system during the course in order to dynamically modify or not the course structure and sequencing previously selected. As the amount of data available for a particular student grows, the learning profile of students may or may not change.

  Anaclitic and Introjective Personality Styles from Patients' Speech","In disentangling the heterogeneity observed in psychopathology, personality of the patients is considered crucial. While it has been demonstrated that personality traits are reflected in the language used by a patient, we hypothesize that this enables automatic inference of the personality type directly from speech utterances, potentially more accurately than through a traditional questionnaire-based approach explicitly designed for personality classification. To validate this hypothesis, we adopt natural language processing (NLP) and standard machine learning tools for classification. We test this on a dataset of recorded clinical diagnostic interviews (CDI) on a sample of 79 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) -- a condition for which differentiated treatment based on personality styles has been advocated -- and classified into anaclitic and introjective personality styles. We start by analyzing the interviews to see which linguistic features are associated with each style, in order to gain a better understanding of the styles. Then, we develop automatic classifiers based on (a) standardized questionnaire responses; (b) basic text features, i.e., TF-IDF scores of words and word sequences; (c) more advanced text features, using LIWC (linguistic inquiry and word count) and context-aware features using BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers); (d) audio features. We find that automated classification with language-derived features (i.e., based on LIWC) significantly outperforms questionnaire-based classification models. Furthermore, the best performance is achieved by combining LIWC with the questionnaire features. This suggests that more work should be put into developing linguistically based automated techniques for characterizing personality, however questionnaires still to some extent complement such methods.","Semere Kiros Bitew,Vincent Schelstraete,Klim Zaporojets,Kimberly Van Nieuwenhove,Reitske Meganck,Chris Develder",arXiv.org,2023.0,"In disentangling the heterogeneity observed in psychopathology, personality of the patients is considered crucial.

This research also analyzed the effect of learning styles on academic performance across different subjects within a medical education program in a Central Asian university.

10.1371/journal.pone.0202211,,,How often do general practitioners use placebos and non-specific interventions? Systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys,"Background 
In a systematic review and meta-analysis we summarize the available evidence on how frequently general practitioners/family physicians (GPs) use pure placebos (e.g., placebo pills) and non-specific therapies (sometimes referred to as impure placebos; e.g., antibiotics for common cold).


Methods 
We searched Medline, PubMed and SCOPUS up to July 2018 to identify cross-sectional quantitative surveys among GPs. Outcomes of primary interest were the percentages of GPs having used any placebo, pure placebos or non-specific therapies at least once in their career, at least once in the last year, at least monthly or at least weekly. Outcomes were described as proportions and pooled with random-effects meta-analysis.


Results 
Of 674 publications, 16 studies from 13 countries with a total of 2.981 participating GPs (range 27 to 783) met the inclusion criteria. The percentage of GPs having used any form of placebo at least once in their career ranged from 29% to 97%, in the last year at least once from 46% to 95%, at least monthly from 15% to 89%, and at least weekly from 1% to 75%. The use of non-specific therapies by far outnumbered the use of pure placebo. For example, the proportion of GPs using pure placebos at least monthly varied between 2% and 15% compared to 53% and 89% for non-specific therapies; use at least weekly varied between 1% and 3% for pure placebos and between 16% and 75% for non-specific therapies. Besides eliciting placebos effects, many other reasons related to patient expectations, demands and medical problems were reported as reasons for applying placebo interventions.


Conclusion 
High prevalence estimates of placebo use among GPs are mainly driven by the frequent use of non-specific therapies; pure placebos are used rarely. The interpretation of our quantitative findings is complicated by the diversity of definitions and survey methods.","Klaus Linde,Klaus Linde,Oxana Atmann,Oxana Atmann,Karin Meißner,Karin Meissner,Antonius Schneider,Antonius Schneider,Richard Meister,Ramona Meister,Levente Kriston,Levente Kriston,Christoph Werner,Christoph Werner",PLOS ONE,2018.0,"Background

The interpretation of our quantitative findings is complicated by the diversity of definitions and survey methods."," The percentage of GPs having used any placebo, pure placebos or non-specific therapies at least once in their career ranged from 29% to 97% in the last year . Non-specific therapy by far outnumbered the use of pure placebo . The interpretation of our quantitative findings is complicated by the diversity of definitions and survey methods ."

A 2013 literature review indicated that medical education literature similarly cites this Pyramid. It was hoped that highlighting this myth in that review would reduce references to the Pyramid in future medical education literature. This study aimed at determining what change in Pyramid citation has occurred in the past 5 years. METHODS: A documented literature review, following the same process as the original review, was conducted. The search dates were September 2012 to April 2018, and the databases were Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Medline and Google Scholar. Sources were from peer-reviewed journals or conferences, in English. RESULTS: From an initial search result of 992 documents, 41 were found to match the criteria. Trends discovered are: the number of Pyramid citations in medical education literature is increasing dramatically, new sources of the Pyramid are now being used, refutations of the Pyramid are being used to support it, and even researchers who acknowledge the weakness of the Pyramid still cite it. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In spite of the 2013 review, the situation has become worse. One possible reason is that refutations use too polite academic wording, and other researchers then consider the Pyramid to be merely ""disputed"" or ""debated."" To kill the myth of the Pyramid, it is necessary for this article's Abstract to state unequivocally: The Pyramid is rubbish, the statistics are rubbish, and they do not come from Edgar Dale.

A point of concern is that the term LS has been used within theories that describe them using completely different notions and categorisations. This is the first empirical study to investigate education professionals’ conceptualisation, as well as means of identifying and implementing LS in their classroom. A sample of 123 education professionals were administered a questionnaire consisting both closed- and open-ended questions. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. LS were found to be mainly conceptualised within the Visual-Auditory-(Reading)-Kinaesthetic (VAK/VARK) framework, as well as Gardner’s multiple intelligences. Moreover, a lot of education professionals confused theories of learning (e.g., behavioural or cognitive theories) with LS. In terms of identifying LS, educators reported using a variety of methods, spanning from observation and everyday contact to the use of tests. The ways LS were implemented in the classroom were numerous, comprising various teaching aids, participatory techniques and motor activities. Overall, we argue that the extended use of the term LS gives the illusion of a consensus amongst educators, when a closer examination reveals that the term LS is conceptualised, identified and implemented idiosyncratically by different individuals.

Educational theory suggests that learning content ideally should be adaptive by considering each student’s learning style. To make learning more optimal, it is necessary to detect learning styles. Several learning detection approaches have been implemented. Conventional methods such as student assessment tests and interviews tend to be more subjective. An objective method of eye-tracking has been researched but limited as a validation tool for differentiating learning styles. To overcome the above mentioned problems, this study proposes a new approach using machine learning and eye-tracking techniques. The experiment and analysis involved 68 students. There were 23 male participants and 45 female participants. In the experiment, participants were assigned to interact with learning content and their eye movements were recorded using an eye-tracker sensor. From the experimental results using three classification algorithms — SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression — and using SVM-RFE as a feature selection method, the best model was achieved by Naive Bayes algorithm through three features selected from SVM-RFE method. The model yielded 71% of accuracy, 60% of sensitivity, and 75% of specificity.

The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) is a questionnaire created to assess students’ preferences regarding how they learn. It was originally designed in English for university students. The objective of the present work is to adapt the ILS questionnaire to Spanish and validate this adapted version, taking into account the cultural characteristics and cognitive level of the recipients, namely Spanish students aged 11–15. Method. We used the Delphi method involving expert opinions for content validation and the Brown and Maydeu-Olivares model, an approach from the Item Response Theory, for construct validation (this model is recommended for forced-choice items). Results. We located new items in the data scrubbing process, which in previous research were missed using classical factor analysis. The results for the global fit of the model show that 32 of the 44 items in the original questionnaire, display optimal values in various indices (RMSEA, CFI, X2, among others), and so this instrument can be used to identify learning style preferences in Spanish adolescents. Discussion. The Brown and Maydeu-Olivares model takes into account the nature of forced-choice items and this is the first the first time it has been applied to the ILS questionnaire. This validation procedure is novel and proves to be an optimal validation method for questionnaires with this type of items.

The article reveals the influence of emotions on the intrinsic student motivation to studies. The aim of the article is to identify the dominant love styles, to validate their impact on the intrinsic student motivation to studies and the types of their motives in order to design a supportive learning environment. Despite the fact that different investigations into the role of emotional factors on learning have been frequently undertaken since the emergence of psychoanalysis, currently, the emotional reaction to the experience of love is insufficiently articulated in educational and methodological literature and is still peripheral. Materials and Methods. The methodological basis of the study is formed by general scientific methods: theoretical analysis and literature review. They are underpinned by a set of specific methods: personality analysis (personalised, environmental and structural approaches), the colour wheel theory of love (J. A. Lee) along with quantitative, qualitative, diagnostic and interpretation methods (N. Ts. Badmaeva). In order to achieve the aim, an analytical and comparative review has been carried out in order to identify the links between emotions and intrinsic student motivation, as well as the main parts of the supportive learning environment. Quantitative and diagnostic methods include two surveys, used as data collection tools. Qualitative and interpretation methods have allowed the authors to determine student motivation through love styles in correlation with types of motives, as well as to design a three-part supportive learning environment based on teaching strategies. Twenty eight students in their third-fourth year of study at University of Tyumen aged between 20 and 25 years majoring in Linguistics have participated in the study. Results. Literature review has shown that emotions are a significant component in cultivating student intrinsic motivation to studies. The authors have identified and described the key components of the supportive learning environment. The results of the diagnostics and their interpretation analysis have shown a high level of love styles’ impact on the student intrinsic motivation to studies and revealed statistically significant links between prevailing love styles and motives. The dominant love styles are Ludus, Pragma and Agape. Assessment of the student motivation level and dominant types of motives has shown that 51 percent of respondents (n=16) have below average or low level of motivation. Among the prevailing motives, the authors highlight the following: communicative, failure avoidance and social motives. These findings have allowed the authors to design a meaningful model of the supportive learning environment based on teaching strategies and to justify its significance. The authors’ model consists of three main parts involving intellectual stimulation, flexible assessment system and reflection. On the one hand, these components result from the prevailing motives influenced by love styles. On the other hand, they are to enhance cognitive (educational) and professional motives.

Educational institutions must ensure that they have access to accurate and relevant data, including student demographics, academic performance records, and even extracurricular activities, to build effective predictive models. Moreover, data privacy and security concerns must be addressed to maintain the integrity of sensitive student information. Next, the choice of machine learning algorithms is crucial. The selection should align with the specific objectives of predicting student success, taking into account the type and volume of data available. Factors such as classification algorithms, regression techniques, and deep learning models must be carefully considered, and their performance must be assessed through rigorous testing and validation. Addressing potential biases in machine learning models is crucial to ensure equitable outcomes. Careful attention must be paid to the training data, as biased data can lead to discriminatory predictions. Ongoing monitoring and model refinement are necessary to minimize these biases and promote fairness in student success predictions.

Educational institutions must ensure that they have access to accurate and relevant data, including student demographics, academic performance records, and even extracurricular activities, to build effective predictive models. Moreover, data privacy and security concerns must be addressed to maintain the integrity of sensitive student information. Next, the choice of machine learning algorithms is crucial. The selection should align with the specific objectives of predicting student success, taking into account the type and volume of data available. Factors such as classification algorithms, regression techniques, and deep learning models must be carefully considered, and their performance must be assessed through rigorous testing and validation. Addressing potential biases in machine learning models is crucial to ensure equitable outcomes. Careful attention must be paid to the training data, as biased data can lead to discriminatory predictions. Ongoing monitoring and model refinement are necessary to minimize these biases and promote fairness in student success predictions.

Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance for application to this method. Our problem is classification of architectural styles of buildings in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. The selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models allows them to be more precise in the classification task. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the architectural style of Mexican buildings. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the traditional cropped image and the prominence maps. In this sense, we show that the performance of the saliency-based CNNs is better than the traditional training reaching a classification rate of 97% in validation dataset. It is considered that style identification with this technique can make a wide contribution in video description tasks, specifically in the automatic documentation of Mexican cultural heritage.","Abraham Montoya Obeso,Abraham Montoya Obeso,Mireya Saraí García Vázquez,Mireya Saraí García Vázquez,Alejandro Acosta,Alejandro Álvaro Ramírez Acosta,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Jenny Benois-Pineau",International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing,2017.0,"The automatic description of multimedia content was mainly developed for classification tasks, retrieval systems and massive ordering of data.

Our group has contributed to this effort through the development of several tools, such as VIP, SICAS, OOP-Anim, SICAS-COL and H-SICAS. Even though we had some positive results, the utilization of these tools doesn’t seem to significantly reduce weaker student’s difficulties. These students need stronger support to motivate them to get engaged in learning activities, inside and outside classroom. Nowadays, many technologies are available to create contexts that may help to accomplish this goal. We consider that a promising path goes through the integration of solutions. In this paper we analyze the features, strengths and weaknesses of the tools developed by our group. Based on these considerations we present a new environment, integrating different types of pedagogical approaches, resources, tools and technologies for programming learning support. With this environment, currently under development, it will be possible to review contents and lessons, based on video and screen captures. The support for collaborative tasks is another key point to improve and stimulate different models of teamwork.

Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.","Frank V.

10.17816/dd430358,,,Learning radiologists’ annotation styles with multi-annotator labeling for improved neural network performance,"BACKGROUND: One of the common problems in labeling medical images is inter-observer variability. The same image can be labeled differently by doctors. The main reasons are the human factor, differences in experience and qualifications, different radiology schools, poor image quality, and unclear instructions. The influence of some factors can be reduced by proper organization of the annotation; however, the opinion of doctors frequently differs.&#x0D; AIM: The study aimed to test whether a neural network with an additional module can learn the style and labeling features of different radiologists and whether such modeling can improve the final metrics of object detection on radiological images.&#x0D; METHODS: For training artificial intelligence systems in radiology, cross-labeling, i.e., annotation of the same image by several doctors, is frequently used. The easiest way is to use labeling from each doctor as an independent example when training the model. Some methods use different rules or algorithms to combine annotation before training. Finally, Guan et al. use separate classification heads to model the labeling style of different doctors. Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for more complex tasks, such as detecting objects on an image. For this analysis, a machine learning model designed to detect objects of different classes on mammographic scans was used. This model is a neural network based on Deformable DETR architecture. A dataset consisting of 7,756 mammographic breast scans and 12,543 unique annotations from 19 doctors was used to train the neural network. For validation and testing, a dataset consisting of 700 and 300 Bi-Rads-labeled scans, respectively, was taken. In all data sets, the proportion of images with pathology was in the 15%20% range. A unique index was assigned to each of the 19 doctors, and a special module at each iteration of the neural network training found a vector corresponding to this index. The vector was expanded to the size of the feature map of each level of the feature pyramid, and then attached by separate channels to the maps. Thus, the encoder and the decoder of the detector had access to the information about which doctor labeled the scan. The vectors were updated using the back-propagation method. Three methods were chosen for comparison:&#x0D; &#x0D; Basic model: Combining labels by different doctors using the voting method.&#x0D; New stylistic module: For predictions on the test dataset, a single doctors index was taken, which showed the best metrics on the validation dataset.&#x0D; New stylistic module: The indexes of the five doctors with the best metrics on the validation dataset were used for predictions on the test dataset.

The software provided reading lessons in a hypermedia format designed as supplementary material for a basal reader series. Because this project was interested in the maintenance of students with mild disabilities in the general education setting, particular attention was given to the reading progress of low-achieving students, as they appeared to be the most at risk for being referred to special education classes.

Studies of conventional systems have suggested that a degree of consistency in the terms assigned to documents by indexers is positively associated with retrieval effectiveness. It is thus of interest to investigate the consistency of assignment of links in separate hypertext versions of the same full‐text document, since a measure of agreement may be related to the subsequent utility of the resulting hypertext databases. The calculation of values indicating the degree of similarity between objects is a technique that has been widely used in the fields of textual and chemical information retrieval; in this paper, we describe the application of arithmetic coefficients and topological indices to the measurement of the degree of similarity between the sets of inter‐nodal links in hypertext databases. We publish the results of a study in which several different sets of links are inserted, by different people, between the paragraphs of each of a number of full‐text documents.

10.1007/11941439_114,,,"Beyond accuracy, f-score and ROC: a family of discriminant measures for performance evaluation","Different evaluation measures assess different characteristics of machine learning algorithms. The empirical evaluation of algorithms and classifiers is a matter of on-going debate among researchers. Most measures in use today focus on a classifier's ability to identify classes correctly. We note other useful properties, such as failure avoidance or class discrimination, and we suggest measures to evaluate such properties.

To construct a strong classifier ensemble, the individual classifiers should be accurate and diverse. However, diversity measure remains a mystery although there were many attempts.

Seventy-four students (75%) completed a learning style test, an on-line questionnaire, and received grades by the end of the semester. The learning style test was the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), which classified students as either field-dependent or field-independent.

This paper proposes an automatic approach for identifying learning styles with respect to the Felder-Silverman learning style model by inferring their learning styles from their behaviour during they are learning in an online course. The approach was developed for learning management systems, which are commonly used in e-learning. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a study with 127 students was performed, comparing the results of the automatic approach with those of a learning style questionnaire. The evaluation yielded good results and demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles.

Cognitive style is not a singleentity. Researchers examining learning styles havevaried views on the exact components andcharacteristics of learning styles. Keefe (1982)stated,Learning styles are cognitive, affective,and physiological traits that serve asrelatively stable indicators of how learnersperceive, interact with, and respond to thelearning environment. (p. 32)The most accepted learning styles range from theConceptual Tempo (Kagan et al., 1964) andHemisphercity (Bjorklund, 1989) approaches tothe Convergent/Divergent thinking (Guilford,1959) and Independent/Dependent (Witkin,Moores, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977) techniques.According to Rasinski (1983), fieldindependence/dependence is “by far” the mostresearched of all cognitive styles. This learningapproach measures how much students are able toovercome the effects of distracting backgroundelements when they attempt to differentiate relevantaspects of a particular situation (Dembo, 1991).Witkin et al. (1977) stated that field independentstudents show greater interest in more impersonal,abstract aspects of various stimuli. In contrast,field dependent students, prefer a higher level ofsocial sensitivity and prefer structured activities thatrequire involvement with others.Dembo (1991) stated the following aboutfield dependent versus field independent studentsand how they interact differently with theirenvironment:Field dependent persons are drawn topeople, favor occupations, such asteaching, that require involvement withothers, and prefer academic areas, suchas the social sciences, that are morepeople oriented. Field independentpersons favor school subjects such asmathematics and the physical sciences,that stress the impersonal and abstract.Field dependent persons are better atlearning and remembering socialmaterial, and field independent personsare better at learning and rememberingimpersonal material. (p. 83)Independent and dependent learning stylehas an impact with respect to academic achievementin classrooms that use computer aided instruction.Cheney (1980) suggested that computer aidedinstruction can be made more effective if it isadapted to an individual’s cognitive style. Post(1987) found similar results in his computer basedresearch. MacGregor, Shapiro, and Niemiec(1988) in researching the effect of computer aidedmathematical instruction, found that although fieldindependent students outperformed field dependentstudents in all teaching methods, field dependentstudents particularly benefited from computer aidedinstruction as it provided the needed cognitivestructure and consistency they lack.A continual dilemma experienced byagricultural educators is how to respond to thechanging face of society and stay abreast of thepossible impacts that technology could have in theteaching-learning context.A relatively newdimension of microcomputer technology entitled,“multimedia” possesses the potential to influencestudent learning and knowledge acquisition.Multimedia is a multi-faceted approach tocomputer-based education that brings together text,graphics, animation, video, still images, audio, andmotion video.Sensing the vast capabilities of multimediain the educational realm, computer companies havedeveloped multimedia software packages that canbe used as teaching tools by instructors.Multimedia can possibly serve as a trenchant26 Vol. 35, No. 1, 1994Journal of Agricultural Education","David Marrison,David L.

(p. 32)The most accepted learning styles range from theConceptual Tempo (Kagan et al., 1964) andHemisphercity (Bjorklund, 1989) approaches tothe Convergent/Divergent thinking (Guilford,1959) and Independent/Dependent (Witkin,Moores, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977) techniques.According to Rasinski (1983), fieldindependence/dependence is “by far” the mostresearched of all cognitive styles. This learningapproach measures how much students are able toovercome the effects of distracting backgroundelements when they attempt to differentiate relevantaspects of a particular situation (Dembo, 1991).Witkin et al. (1977) stated that field independentstudents show greater interest in more impersonal,abstract aspects of various stimuli. In contrast,field dependent students, prefer a higher level ofsocial sensitivity and prefer structured activities thatrequire involvement with others.Dembo (1991) stated the following aboutfield dependent versus field independent studentsand how they interact differently with theirenvironment:Field dependent persons are drawn topeople, favor occupations, such asteaching, that require involvement withothers, and prefer academic areas, suchas the social sciences, that are morepeople oriented. Field independentpersons favor school subjects such asmathematics and the physical sciences,that stress the impersonal and abstract.Field dependent persons are better atlearning and remembering socialmaterial, and field independent personsare better at learning and rememberingimpersonal material. (p. 83)Independent and dependent learning stylehas an impact with respect to academic achievementin classrooms that use computer aided instruction.Cheney (1980) suggested that computer aidedinstruction can be made more effective if it isadapted to an individual’s cognitive style. Post(1987) found similar results in his computer basedresearch. MacGregor, Shapiro, and Niemiec(1988) in researching the effect of computer aidedmathematical instruction, found that although fieldindependent students outperformed field dependentstudents in all teaching methods, field dependentstudents particularly benefited from computer aidedinstruction as it provided the needed cognitivestructure and consistency they lack.A continual dilemma experienced byagricultural educators is how to respond to thechanging face of society and stay abreast of thepossible impacts that technology could have in theteaching-learning context.A relatively newdimension of microcomputer technology entitled,“multimedia” possesses the potential to influencestudent learning and knowledge acquisition.Multimedia is a multi-faceted approach tocomputer-based education that brings together text,graphics, animation, video, still images, audio, andmotion video.Sensing the vast capabilities of multimediain the educational realm, computer companies havedeveloped multimedia software packages that canbe used as teaching tools by instructors.Multimedia can possibly serve as a trenchant26 Vol. 35, No. 1, 1994Journal of Agricultural Education"," Researchers examining learning styles havevaried views on the exact components andcharacteristics of learning styles .

Thus in this paper we have proposed an approach for detecting learning styles automatically, based on Felder and Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) and using machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach is composed of two parts: The first part aims to extract the learners’ sequences from the log file, and then using an unsupervised algorithm (K-means) in order to group them into sixteen clusters according to the FSLSM, and the second part consists in using a supervised algorithm (Naive Bayes) to predict the learning style for a new sequence or a new learner.

Among these studies, adaptive learning has become an increasingly important issue. The traditional classification approaches analyze only the surface characteristics of students but fail to classify students accurately in terms of deep learning features. Meanwhile, these approaches are unable to analyze these high-dimensional learning behaviors in massive amounts of data. Hence, we propose a learning style classification approach based on the deep belief network (DBN) for large-scale online education to identify students’ learning styles and classify them. The first step is to build a learning style model and identify indicators of learning style based on the experiences of experts; then, relate the indicators to the different learning styles. We improve the DBN model and identify a student’s learning style by analyzing each individual’s learning style features using the improved DBN. Finally, we verify the DBN result by conducting practical experiments on an actual educational dataset. The various learning styles are determined by soliciting questionnaires from students based on the ILS theory by Felder and Soloman (1996) and the Readiness for Education At a Distance Indicator.

10.3991/ijoe.v17i10.24499,,,A Novel Approach for Parkinson’s Disease Detection Based on Voice Classification and Features Selection Techniques,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most widespread diseases that, primarily, affects the motor system of the neural central system. In fact, PD is characterized by tremors, stiffness of the muscles, imprecise gait movements, and vocal impairment. An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is usually based on many neurological, psychological, and physical investigations despite the fact that its main symptoms cannot be easily decorrelated from other diseases. As such, many automatic diagnostic support systems based on Machine Learning approaches have been recently employed to assist the PD patients' assessment. In the current paper, a comparative analysis was performed on machine learning (ML) techniques for PD identification based on voice disorders analysis. These ML methods included the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms.

As such, many automatic diagnostic support systems based on Machine Learning approaches have been recently employed to assist the PD patients' assessment. In the current paper, a comparative analysis was performed on machine learning (ML) techniques for PD identification based on voice disorders analysis.

10.32604/iasc.2022.022179,,,Combining CNN and Grad-Cam for COVID-19 Disease Prediction and Visual Explanation,"With daily increasing of suspected COVID-19 cases, the likelihood of the virus mutation increases also causing the appearance of virulent variants having a high level of replication. Automatic diagnosis methods of COVID-19 disease are very important in the medical community. An automatic diagnosis could be performed using machine and deep learning techniques to analyze and classify different lung X-ray images. Many research studies proposed automatic methods for detecting and predicting COVID-19 patients based on their clinical data. In the leak of valid X-ray images for patients with COVID-19 datasets, several researchers proposed to use augmentation techniques to bypass this limitation. However, the obtained results by augmentation techniques are not efficient to be projected for the real world. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method to analyze and distinguish COVID-19 cases from other pneumonia and normal cases using the transfer learning technique. To help doctors easily interpret the results, a recent visual explanation method called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is applied for each class. This technique is used in order to highlight the regions of interest on the X-ray image, so that, the model prediction result can be easily interpreted by the doctors. This method allows doctors to focus only on the important parts of the image and evaluate the efficiency of the concerned model. Three selected deep learning models namely VGG16, VGG19, and MobileNet, were used in the experiments with transfer learning technique. To bypass the limitation of the leak of lung X-ray images of patients with COVID-19 disease, we propose to combine several different datasets in order to assemble a new dataset with sufficient real data to accomplish accurately the training step.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most practical method for detecting brain tumors. Through these MRIs, doctors analyze and identify abnormal tissue growth and can confirm whether the brain is affected by a tumor or not. Today, with the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques, the detection of brain tumors is done by applying the techniques and algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. The advantages of the application of these algorithms are the quick prediction of brain tumors, fewer errors, and greater precision, which help in decision-making and in choosing the most appropriate treatment for patients. In the proposed work, a convolution neural network (CNN) is applied with the aim of detecting the presence of a brain tumor and its performance is analyzed. The main purpose of this article is to adopt the approach of convolutional neural networks as a machine learning technique to perform brain tumor detection and classification.

10.1016/j.atech.2022.100151,,,Mask R-CNN based apple flower detection and king flower identification for precision pollination,"Identification of individual king flowers within flower clusters is a critical step for developing a robotic apple pollination system. Typically, each cluster has five to six individual flowers, and the king flower can be occluded by the lateral flowers because of their central position in a flower cluster. King flowers share identical features (e.g., color, shape, and size) with other flowers. Apple flower clusters open sequentially from the king flower to the lateral flowers in the time of anthesis, which presents an opportunity for selective pollination. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the flower blooming stage for accurately determining the pollination targets and timing. In this study, a machine vision system was developed to acquire images for two apple varieties in the orchard environment. A Mask R-CNN-based detection model followed by a king flower segmentation algorithm were developed to identify and locate the king flowers from an apple flower dataset throughout the blooming stage from first king bloom to full bloom. The flower detection accuracy resulting from the algorithm were compared with ground truth measurements. The king flower detection accuracy varied from 98.7% to 65.6% with respect to the flower stages of 20% to 80% blooming. This information can be used to calculate the percentage of the king flowers and the distribution in the tree canopy.

Synthetic oversampling methods address this problem by generating the synthetic minority class samples to balance the distribution between the samples of the majority and minority classes. This paper identifies that most of the existing oversampling methods may generate the wrong synthetic minority samples in some scenarios and make learning tasks harder. To this end, a new method, called Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling TEchnique (MWMOTE), is presented for efficiently handling imbalanced learning problems. MWMOTE first identifies the hard-to-learn informative minority class samples and assigns them weights according to their euclidean distance from the nearest majority class samples. It then generates the synthetic samples from the weighted informative minority class samples using a clustering approach. This is done in such a way that all the generated samples lie inside some minority class cluster. MWMOTE has been evaluated extensively on four artificial and 20 real-world data sets. The simulation results show that our method is better than or comparable with some other existing methods in terms of various assessment metrics, such as geometric mean (G-mean) and area under the receiver operating curve (ROC), usually known as area under curve (AUC).","Suman Barua,Sukarna Barua,Md.

Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level.

Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues.

In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques.

We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer.

,,,Analysing the relationship of sequential and global learning styles on students’ historical thinking and understanding : a case study on form four secondary schools students in Malaysia,"This study ascertained on the relationship between students’ learning styles, which are global and
sequential learning styles with their historical understanding and thinking. The specific objectives of the study were to: describe the learning style of the students which are sequential and global; to find out
whether students’ historical understanding and thinking differ with their learning styles; and determine the
difference between the learning style and their historical understanding and thinking. The participants of the study consist of 40 Form Four Secondary School students from a National School in Kedah State,
Malaysia. The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) questionnaire was utilized to carry out the rationale of the study. The results demonstrated that generally the students are fairly well balanced in global and
sequential learning styles presented in the ILS questionnaire. An assessment test of history essay writing was used to determine their historical thinking from four categories, which are a) chronological
understanding, b) make interpretation, c) express opinions with a sense of empathy, and d) make rationalizations. The results show that there is a significance difference between the sequential learner and the global learner in chronological understanding. Overall, there is no significant difference between
students’ learning styles with the ability in making interpretation make rationalization and express an

10.1109/13.746332,,,Enhancing student learning through hypermedia courseware and incorporation of student learning styles,"This paper outlines attempts to enhance student learning by addressing different learning styles through course hypermedia. Students learn by a variety of different learning styles. Previously, instructors were unable to effectively address these different learning styles outside the classroom. Two approaches were developed to address this problem. The first approach was the development of hypermedia courseware. This provided a wide variety of tools which students could use to prepare for lessons. In this way students retained complete control over how they prepared for a lesson and could choose those hypermedia tools that were most conducive to their learning. An assessment of the multimedia and hypertext documents in the course revealed that the value of a particular multimedia tool to a student varied widely. Each student was traversing the course material according to his/her unique learning style. Unfortunately, the plethora of tools confused some students because they were uncomfortable making active choices of what course material would be most conducive to their learning. As a result, a second approach was adopted. An adaptive hypermedia interface was developed that provided dynamic tailoring of the presentation of course material based on the individual student's learning style. By tailoring the presentation of material to the student's learning style, the authors believe students learned more efficiently and more effectively.","Curtis A. Carver,Curtis A.

In this way students retained complete control over how they prepared for a lesson and could choose those hypermedia tools that were most conducive to their learning. An assessment of the multimedia and hypertext documents in the course revealed that the value of a particular multimedia tool to a student varied widely. Each student was traversing the course material according to his/her unique learning style. Unfortunately, the plethora of tools confused some students because they were uncomfortable making active choices of what course material would be most conducive to their learning. As a result, a second approach was adopted. An adaptive hypermedia interface was developed that provided dynamic tailoring of the presentation of course material based on the individual student's learning style. By tailoring the presentation of material to the student's learning style, the authors believe students learned more efficiently and more effectively.", This paper outlines attempts to enhance student learning by addressing different learning styles through course hypermedia . An assessment of the multimedia and hypertext documents in the course revealed that the value of a particular multimedia tool to a student varied widely .

The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Honey and Mumford’s (1986) learning styles questionnaire (LSQ) in the context of United Arab Emirates (UAE) higher education. In particular, it aims at exploring the learning style preferences of United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) students using LSQ. It also investigates whether there are statistically significant differences in students’ learning style preferences because of their demographic and academic characteristics.




Design/methodology/approach




Data were collected from a sample of 1,463 undergraduate students at the UAEU. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present the main characteristics of respondents, to explore the learning style preferences of UAEU students and to find out whether there are significant differences in students’ learning style preferences because of their demographic and academic characteristics.




Findings




Results indicated that UAEU students have strong preferences for the four learning styles. Results showed that about 68 per cent of UAEU students have strong or very strong preferences for the activist leaning style, whereas about 84 per cent have strong or very strong preferences for the reflector learning style, 78 per cent have strong or very strong preferences for the theorist learning style; about 60 per cent have strong or very strong preferences for the pragmatist learning style. Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in certain learning styles because of students’ demographic and academic characteristics.




Research limitations/implications




There are a number of limitations associated with this study. First, data were collected from a single university in the UAE. Second, the results are based on a self-report survey and this in turn might affect the reliability of the results. Another limitation is that this study is of snapshot type. Hence, it might not capture the dynamic nature of learning style. On the other hand, it has a number of implications for students, educators and administrators.

First, the significance value of the students’ cognitive learning styles variable equals to 0,000 <   α =5%, so it was concluded that the students’ cognitive learning styles strongly influenced their learning outcomes in Thermodynamic Science course manifested in the form of either dependent or independent cognitive styles. Second,   the students’ learning independence variable turned out to be not having any significant relationship with the students’ learning outcomes in Thermodynamic. The learning independence variable had no significant influence on the students’ learning outcomes with the level of significance of dependent cognitive style 0.007 <   α =5%, so it was concluded that the dependent cognitive learning style influenced the learning outcomes, and the learning independence as well as cognitive learning styles, especially the dependent type, altogether influenced the students’ learning outcomes in Thermodynamic. The learning independence variable significantly had no influence on the learning outcomes, with 0.007   <   α =5% meaning that the dependent cognitive learning style strongly influenced the learning outcomes.", Open University students rely heavily on the cognitive learning styles that they have in attempt to get maximum scores in every final exam .

10.5539/ies.v11n10p50,,,Learning Style Preferences among College Students,"The purpose of this study was to determine what factors other than individual preferences affect undergraduate students’ learning style preferences, if learning style is influenced by gender, age, college affiliation and/or type of activities. A total of 185 students from the University of Bahrain, Bahrain, participated in an online VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic) for younger people questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 16 items about learning style preferences and three about participants’ demographics. The results showed that participants generally preferred multi-modular learning style with both kinesthetic and visual learning styling being most preferred while Reading/Writing was the least preferred. Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences between students learning styles based on age and gender, but it was a moderate difference. What mostly affected the preferences, however, was the type of activities or tasks, something which in turn resulted in some difference among colleges. This suggests that VARK preferences need to be related to activity type rather than be observed at individual reference. Recommendations were provided at the end of the study.","Lamya Alkooheji,Lamya Alkooheji,Abdulghani Al-Hattami,Abdulghani Al-Hattami",International Education Studies,2018.0,"The purpose of this study was to determine what factors other than individual preferences affect undergraduate students’ learning style preferences, if learning style is influenced by gender, age, college affiliation and/or type of activities.

This study aimed to determine students’ learning styles and investigate the relationship between learning style and satisfaction with different instruction approaches and components of the ICM. One hundred and twenty-one second-year dental students participated in this study, which had a 77.6% participation rate. The Kolb Learning Style Inventory, a sociodemographic questionnaire, and a satisfaction survey were administered after course completion. In both the traditional and ICM classes, most of the participants were convergers (56.9 and 54%) and assimilators (20.7 and 25.4%), and the rest of the participants were accommodators (15.5 and 12.7%) and divergers (6.9 and 8%). Learning style did not influence participants’ satisfaction and did not predict their satisfaction with the traditional and ICM approaches. The satisfaction scores for the four components of the ICM were not significantly different by learning style. The mean satisfaction scores of the ICM approach were higher than those of the traditional approach in all learning style groups. All of the participants in the ICM class were more satisfied with the online and teacher-student interaction components than the student group discussion and presentation components.

Of 72 students enrolled in a required second-year pharmacology course, 22 students volunteered to play the board game, which was followed by an in-class examination consisting of 42 ANS questions (ANSQs) and 8 control questions (CTLQs). Participants were given a pretest and a posttest to assess immediate educational improvement. Participants’ scores for pretest, posttest, in-class examination, and ANSQs were compared. Also, scores for examination, ANSQs, and CTLQs were compared between board game participants (PART) and nonparticipating classmates (NPART).

Assessment. Board game participants scored progressively higher between the pretest, posttest, examination, and ANSQs. Additionally, PART scores were higher than NPART scores for examination and ANSQs. Difference between PART and NPART CTLQ scores was not significant.

Conclusion. A board game can assist PharmD students in learning ANS pharmacology."," Of 72 students enrolled in a required second-year pharmacology course, 22 students volunteered to play a board game . Board game participants scored progressively higher between the pretest, posttest, examination, and ANSQs . Difference between PART and NPART CTLQ scores was not significant ."

10.1145/3231709,,,An Empirical Investigation on the Benefits of Gamification in Programming Courses,"Context: Programming courses are compulsory for most engineering degrees, but students’ performance on these courses is often not as good as expected. Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course.

Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students’ learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler.

Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively.

Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform.

Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students’ performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.","Beatriz Marín,B.

In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field.  To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N=819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.","Jonna Koivisto,Jonna Koivisto,Juho Hamari,Juho Hamari",International Journal of Information Management,2019.0,"Abstract   Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified.

10.1109/access.2017.2654247,,,A Systematic Review on Educational Data Mining,"Presently, educational institutions compile and store huge volumes of data, such as student enrolment and attendance records, as well as their examination results. Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function.

Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function.

The present study synthesizes the expectation–confirmation model (ECM) and affordance theory to explain better the continuance use of e-learning and the benefits users perceive after initial use. We have adjoined these two theoretical models for the following reasons, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have combined ECM with affordance theory. The study followed a survey method, and a total of 466 respondents were contacted. The model was tested using the structural equation modelling technique through the Partial Least square method. The research study highlights a model with three layers of relationships with affordances triggering the expectations about the utility and usability of e-learning technologies. Furthermore, the findings of this study has indicated that all the proposed hypotheses are supported. Specifically, this study has reported that perceived usefulness is found to be a key variable that plays an essential role in determining the success of online learning platforms. Subsequently, the study offers a theoretical narrative for user satisfaction and loyalty toward e-learning platforms in light of the ECM and the Affordance Theory.

10.5688/ajpe79345,25995520.0,,Pillars and Foundations of Quality for Continuing Education in Pharmacy,"While many countries have made major changes to the way that the members of the health workforce are educated and trained before entering service, not as much attention has been given to models and approaches—including regulatory systems—that assure on-going competence and support practitioners’ professional development. Not all countries have postgraduate requirements for practice (such as licensure or registration) beyond graduation from an approved educational program, nor for maintenance of licensure/registration, where applicable. Although the number is growing, few countries have national systems or structures in place to ensure the quality of continuing education (CE) activities.3 Substantial differences in requirements for pharmacist relicensure exist globally in terms of quality and quantity of CE. Even within some countries, differences exist.4

Uptake and implementation of the continuing professional development (CPD) model has been slow. Not all pharmacists are convinced yet of the benefits of the model, which entails more learner effort and engagement than traditional CE.5 Moreover, self-directed lifelong learning requires certain skills and attitudes best developed before graduation; adult learners achieving them is likely to be more of a challenge.6 Factors beyond methodology also impact the outcomes and impact of learning; these include organizational, political, and regulatory constraints.

In countries that have requirements for CE or CPD, systems are credit-based or time-based, and learners are, in most cases, only required to produce evidence of participation in a specified minimum quantity of CE. Not all countries have systems or standards in place to ensure quality educational activities, and where they do exist, they largely focus on the structure and process of the educational activity. There are generally no requirements for the learner to provide rationale for participation in the activity (context; ie, relevance or identified learning need or goal), evidence of meaningful personal learning (outcomes), or changes to practice and improvements for patients (impact).7

Therefore, pharmacists pursuing educational activities or employers investing in employee development and directing educational efforts often rely on a subjective assessment of the quality and benefits of that education. Quality assurance systems for CE must consider real health care needs and priorities, which should be adopted at the individual, organizational, and national levels and include multidisciplinary and transnational approaches.

Challenges in pharmacy continuing education
As the need for new competencies grows, quantity but not necessarily quality educational programs increase. Pharmacists may avoid more demanding and time-intensive educational activities, given that pharmacists have cited time as a barrier to adopting the CPD approach.8,9 Knowledge-based activities can be delivered in a relatively shorter time, but application and practice-based activities—as defined by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE)—take longer. In recent years, knowledge-based activities have constituted more than 90% of ACPE-accredited CE activities.10 Higher quality educational activities are likely to be more complex but, therefore, more expensive to provide, and cost is also a barrier to participation.9 National organizations and universities that organize such activities may be challenged to attract enough participants. Many pharmacists pursue CE only to fulfill the requirement of collecting CE points or credits for license renewal. Sometimes they collect points despite only passive involvement, and in some cases, only declare their presence at the education sessions. Outcomes of the training and willingness to apply the learning to practice are rarely evaluated or quality assured.

Leading organizations have called for radical changes in CE models for health professionals, and CPD has been advocated as a promising model.2 Continuing professional development entails lifelong active participation in learning activities that assists individuals in developing and maintaining continuing competence, in enhancing their professional practice, and in supporting achievement of their career goals.11 This method is also described as a self-directed, ongoing, systematic, and outcomes-focused approach to learning and professional development.12

The need to expand and equip the global health workforce to meet societal needs has resulted in increased capacity in education and training. In some countries, this expansion has been achieved, but not always qualitatively. In recent years, the International Pharmaceutical Federation’s Education Initiative (FIPEd) initiated and developed competency-based educational models, including programs and frameworks to evaluate and enhance the quality of education and to support countries in their own quality improvement and capacity-building initiatives.13 New models for self-directed lifelong learning are advocated, which, can be used to tailor, document, and evaluate individualized educational plans to develop health care professionals’ competencies. 14-16","Arijana Meštrović,Arijana Meštrović,Michael J.

Design. Fourth-year pharmacy students were randomly assigned to participate in either online branched-case learning using a virtual simulation platform or a small-group discussion. Preexperience and postexperience student assessments and a survey instrument were completed.

Evaluation. While there were no significant differences in the preexperience test scores between the groups, there was a significant increase in scores in both the virtual-patient group and the PBL group between the preexperience and postexperience tests. The PBL group had higher postexperience test scores (74.8±11.7) than did the virtual-patient group (66.5±13.6) (p=0.001).

,,,Understanding Performance Anxiety,"WITHIN THE VOCAL COMMUNITY EXISTS a convenient notion, asserting that there will be very little difference between the performance levels of equally elite singers. For example, at an audition in which the vocal skills of all singing participants are truly on a par, this theory would assume that each of these singers should perform as well as the other. But this is not the case. Why? The major factor most likely to distinguish the best performance from a mediocre one is the singer's ability to cope with psychologic pressure. This ability might include such elements as self-confidence, concentration, motivation, and effort. Consistently, however, one crucial factor is the ability to handle the stresses and strains of the performing situation. This article will consider the term ""performance"" to include auditions, competitions, concerts, recitals, and fully costumed and staged works. Today's top-level singers find themselves in a highly competitive environment whose rewards (success) and disappointments (failure) are often great-thus, a truly volatile mix that causes stress. When speaking and working with singers, it is quite evident that they all do not perceive stress necessarily as a negative phenomenon. On the contrary, those who find that stress can be useful always make an effort to perceive stresses of performance in a positive way. Other singers need to feel under pressure to perform well, meaning that pressure improves their performances in comparison with their practice sessions. Singing demands fine manipulative skills; as a consequence, singers can cope with only low to medium levels of stress before their performance is affected detrimentally. It therefore becomes critical that individual singers understand just how much stress they can manage before it interferes with their performances. The singing world is populated by performers who have talent and potential, who do very well in practice, but seldom manage to reproduce this level in performance. Many if not all such performers who experience problems handling performance pressure will identify themselves as being ""anxious,"" especially before and during performance. What Differentiates between Stress, Anxiety, and Arousal in Performance? Although these three terms are often used interchangeably, stress tends to be the result of the interaction between the singer and the environment.1 Therefore, the singers' thought processes or cognitive appraisal of the stressor are critical ingredients in the stress equation. All performances are thus stressors. Whether, however, the environment causes an anxious response in performers will depend on the appraisal of their ability to meet the demands of the performing situation. Examples of stressors include: * the very presence of the audition panel; * another singer performing the same repertoire; * the presence of the voice teacher during an audition or competition; * an opening night with press present; * an accompanist arriving late; * bad weather drastically cutting the size of the audience; * an ill-fitting costume; * a critical attitude on the part of the conductor; * the presence in the audience of a musical V.I.P. In this ""interactionist"" model, stress in performance can be perceived in two different ways: positively, in which the singer copes with the stress and shows little anxiety, or negatively, which leads to symptoms of anxiety in the performer, thus influencing the performance badly. This less effective performance is the result when the stressor is viewed as a threat, when the performer's perception is that he or she lacks the personal resources to respond to such a threat, thereby producing anxiety. The situation is made more complex in this way: the same singer's response to the performance will vary according to the specific environmental stressors. In one performance there might be little anxiety, but in another the level could be higher. …","Shirlee Emmons,Shirlee Emmons,Alma Thomas,Alma Thomas",Journal of Singing,2008.0,"WITHIN THE VOCAL COMMUNITY EXISTS a convenient notion, asserting that there will be very little difference between the performance levels of equally elite singers.

This less effective performance is the result when the stressor is viewed as a threat, when the performer's perception is that he or she lacks the personal resources to respond to such a threat, thereby producing anxiety. The situation is made more complex in this way: the same singer's response to the performance will vary according to the specific environmental stressors. In one performance there might be little anxiety, but in another the level could be higher. …"," Top-level singers find themselves in a highly competitive environment whose rewards (success) and disappointments (failure) are often great-thus, a volatile mix that causes stress . Singing demands fine manipulative skills; as a consequence, singers can cope with only low to medium levels of stress before their performance is affected detrimentally ."

,,,What Laboratory Research has Told Us about Dolphin Cognition,"Studies of sensory, cognitive, and communicative skills of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were carried out over a 34-year period at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory in Honolulu. Findings on sensory skills included fine discrimination of auditory frequency differences andauditory duration, good visual resolution capabilities in water and in air, and sharing of object recognition across the senses of vision and echolocation. Short-term memory for auditory and visual materials was well developed, including memory for lists of items. Concept learning was demonstrated within several paradigms, including discrimination learning sets and matching-to sample. Dolphins understood novel instructions conveyed within artificial gestural or acoustic language systems using “sentences” as long as five words whose interpretation required processing of both the semantic and syntactic features of the languages. Gestural instructions were understood as reliably when conveyed through television images of trainers as when conveyed by live trainers. The words of these languages were understood referentially, including an ability to report whether a referenced object was present or absent in the dolphin’s tank. Both vocal mimicry of novel sounds and behavioral (motor) mimicry of other dolphins and of humans was demonstrated, an extensive and unique dual ability among animals tested, including an understanding of the concept of imitate as well as an understanding of the concept of behavioral synchrony. Behavioral synchrony (two dolphins acting together) was carried out effectively for behaviors directed by a trainer and for self directedbehaviors. The dolphins understood the referring function of the human pointing gesture,possibly as a generalization from the referring function of their echolocation beam. Self-awarenesswas demonstrated in two domains: the dolphin’s conscious awareness of its own recent behavior, and its conscious awareness of its own body parts when symbolically referenced. This suite of findings attest to the remarkable flexibility and extensibility of dolphin cognition and reveals cognitive competencies that surely aid the dolphin’s effective functioning within its complex social and ecological milieu.","Louis M.

,,,Creativity in Engineering Education.,"There has been much discussion in recent years on the need for creative engineers in American industry and the associated need for engineering schools to foster creative thinking ability in their students. The first problem one encounters when thinking about how these needs might be addressed is that while creativity has been exhaustively studied, it has never been satisfactorily defined. There is general agreement, however, that creativity (whatever it is) involves the ability to put things (words, concepts, methods, devices) together in novel ways. Moreover, at least some types of creative ability are thought to involve skill at divergent production—generation of many possible solutions to a given problem—as opposed to convergent production, or generation of “the right answer.”","Richard M.

,,,Volitional Control of Vibrato in Trained Singers,"INTRODUCTION WHEN A SINGER IS AFFLICTED with a too fast or too slow vibrato rate, does physiological hard wiring condemn him to that condition for life, or can he change it over time? In search of the answer to that question, Neisha Carter, a graduate student in the Speech Pathology program at Brigham Young University, under the direction of Dr. Christopher Dromey, her faculty mentor in her department, and in conjunction with Dr. J. Arden Hopkin, a professor in the School of Music, prepared a controlled study leading to her thesis, ""Volitional Changes to Vocal Vibrato in Accomplished Singers"" (2001). The study systematically investigated an informal experiment drawn from the undergraduate voice pedagogy course at BYU. At the end of the unit on vibrato in the voice pedagogy class, the professor requests volunteers from the class to participate in an informal experiment. A student with a fast vibrato joins a singer with slow vibrato. In turn, these two students attempt to match each other's vibrato: one singer sustains a tone in a comfortable range and the other joins in after a moment, seeking to match the other student's vibrato. Class members are always impressed that the faster vibrato slows down and the slower vibrato speeds up during the experiment. Students customarily explain that they adjust their vibrato by adjusting placement and breath energy: the fast vibrato slows as placement moves back and as breath pressure diminishes; the slow vibrato speeds up as placement moves more forward and the breath pressure increases. Interestingly, in every repetition of the experiment, students report matching the tone quality of the other student as a means of matching vibrato: as the brighter voice becomes darker and the production heavier, the vibrato slows; the naturally dark voice brightens and lightens to speed up the vibrato. This informal experiment prompted the study leading to the thesis. A thorough survey of existing literature on the subject gave meaningful context to the study and its results. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Definitions of Vibrato A variety of definitions by researchers has contributed to the description of vibrato. Lebon viewed vibrato as a characteristic of a tone quality that adds vibrancy and richness, suggesting that vibrato that calls attention to itself or is obtrusive becomes a negative attribute.1 Large and Iwata found that vibrato added warmth and excitement to the tone.2 Carl Seashore was the first to study vibrato extensively. Cited to this day, his definition states: ""A good vibrato is a pulsation of pitch, usually accompanied with synchronous pulsations of loudness and timbre, of such extent and rate as to give a pleasing flexibility, tenderness, and richness to the tones.""3 Pfautsch described vibrato as ""a slight and rapid fluctuation between two pitches in producing the singing voice.""4 Callaghan explained the movement of vibrato to have a wavelike form when describing vibrato as ""an undulation of the fundamental frequency.""5 Pfautsch found the following characteristics in all vibratos and tone productions: (1) There will be two pitches involved, (2) there will be variance in the two pitches involved, (3) there will be variance in the width between the two pitches involved, (4) there will be differences in the speed at which these two pitches are sung, and (5) one of the two pitches will dominate either by volume, by duration, or by both volume and duration.6 In the above description, Pfautsch described vibrato in simplistic terms that enabled the inexperienced singer to understand the phenomenon of vibrato. Although the above distinctions are present during vibrato, the use of vibrato is viewed to be both an advantage and a disadvantage to the singing voice. Metfessel characterized vibrato as ""a mannerism which soon becomes wearisome; a drawback and a sin which should be nipped in the bud; a disagreeable fault to be condemned, a dangerous vice to be shunned, a vicious wavering used by inferior talent, and a vulgarity. …","Neisha Carter,Neisha Carter,J.

10.21061/jte.v23i2.a.4,,,"A Comparative Analysis of Preferred Learning and Teaching Styles for Engineering, Industrial, and Technology Education Students and Faculty","This study showed that while there was some variation within majors, the overall dominant learning style in the materials process course was the kinesthetic style. While this was a result the researchers expected, the technology education students were unexpected outliers from the rest of the group. From the Kruskal and Wallis test, the researchers observed a statistical significance (0.041*) between the three groups for the read/write learning style with the technology education students rating it the most preferred learning style. This does raise additional questions for researchers. Based on how the curriculum is often developed and delivered, technology education is typically a very hands-on, kinesthetic discipline. In fact, the content is more kinesthetically based than industrial technology and engineering technology programs, yet students from these other disciplines rated kinesthetic learning as more important than the technology education students. Further research is needed to determine if technology education as a discipline should shift a little more toward the read/write delivery method, sacrificing some of the kinesthetic teaching in the process. These results could also be due to the grass being greener on the other side of the fence. As engineering technology and industrial technology students do not have as much kinesthetic-based learning in their programs, they may see it as a better, more preferred, option of getting content.

There are different multimedia tools. Three of the most popular ones are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic in which students take in information. Some students are visual learners, while others are auditory or kinaesthetic learners. While students use all of their senses to take in information, they seem to have preferences in how they learn best. In order to help students learn, teachers need to teach as many of these preferences as possible. Therefore, teachers can incorporate these multimedia tools in their curriculum activities so that students are able to succeed in their classes. This study is an analysis of multimedia tools for Iranian EFL students. Over 100 students complete a questionnaire to determine if their multimedia tools are auditory, visual, or kinaesthetic.

Todas estas acciones se realizan en un contexto de modernizacion de las escuelas y cambio de paradigma docente que, en este caso, implica la preponderancia de los procesos de adquisicion sobre los de aprendizaje (Ellis, 1997) y por tanto de las destrezas orales sobre las escritas (Nunan, 1995).

,,,A mixed methods investigation of post-secondary students' long bone anatomy knowledge retention through constructivism and the works of Vesalius,"Understanding human long bone anatomy is an important concept to master for post-secondary students that major in medical fields since skeletal structures assist in locating a pulse, conducting clinical procedures, and identifying injection sites. Skeletal anatomy is also used to name structures associated with other organ systems like veins, arteries, and nerves. This explanatory mixed methods study explores post-secondary students’ knowledge retention and perception of various constructivist activities that utilize historical approaches based on the works of Vesalius, the Father of Modern Anatomy to teach long bone anatomy. Three treatment groups and one controlled comparison group (n= 92) were provided an online demographic survey, pre and posttests the day of the experimental lesson, a questionnaire regarding enjoyment and utilization of the activity, and two additional posttests given four and twelve weeks after the activity to gather knowledge retention data. Thirteen participants who fell within the quantitative tails of the first posttest assessment were interviewed regarding the activity. Coded interviews, field notes, observations and quantitative data were used for meta-inference. The data suggests that the osteology activities that incorporate historical and constructivist aspects increased students’ enjoyment, knowledge retention, and self-directed learning outside the classroom. The group that utilized multiple learning modalities through drawing and creating mental maps with blindfolds showed a positive significant difference (p < 0.05) among other treatments with respect to knowledge retention twelve weeks after the activity. Meta-inference of data suggests the utilization of constructivist activities that cater to several learning modalities will facilitate partner interaction, increase laboratory enjoyment, provide students with additional study techniques, and enhance knowledge retention the day of the activity and twelve weeks after the activity. This study fills a gap in the literature in which the incorporation of constructivist activities designed using historicality of cognition, active and meaningful learning have not been explored with regards to knowledge retention within an osteology laboratory setting.

10.32597/dissertations/1746,,,"The Effect of the Vocabulary Spelling City App on Student Performance in Spelling, Vocabulary, and Reading Comprehension in Grades 5-8 at Glenview Adventist Academy","Problem and Purpose Students in fifth through eighth grades at Glenview Adventist Academy (GAA) presented difficulties in the subjects of spelling, vocabulary and reading comprehension. The school had not followed the previous 10-year trend of technology implementation in the classroom, in spite of conclusive research on its advantages. This study was conducted to determine to what extent teaching methodology and the use of technology could affect academic performance in the areas of spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Research on the implementation of software and the use of tablets (iPad Minis) in the classroom has been scarce and contradictory in the past decade (Heinrich, 2012; Roser, 2017). Hence, the need to conduct a study which would provide input in this area to guide future curriculum and technology implementation decisions for GAA and the Arizona Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Department of Education. Method A quantitative quasi-experimental design was utilized. Elementary students from Grades 5 through 8, enrolled at GAA during school years 2013–2016 (the experimental or technology group), were exposed to the use of the software Vocabulary Spelling City (VSC) through a technology medium named iPad minis. Students from the same grades from the other schools of the Arizona Conference of Seventh-day Adventist were chosen to be the control group. All students from the Arizona Conference of Seventh-day Adventists were tested academically in the areas of spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension using ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills) during September and again in April for three consecutive years. SPSS software was used to enter the test results, and to conduct a sample paired t test, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and a repeated measures of covariance. Findings A significant difference between groups was found among the students who experienced the technology intervention when compared to their performance during the previous year when they were taught using the traditional methods of teaching spelling (p = 0.038). No group difference was found in both groups of students (experimental and control) between pretest and posttest in spelling (p = 0.652; η2 = 0.002) during the first year of technology and software implementation (iPad mini and VSC). After conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of two years, there was no significant difference in spelling performance when compared to their counterparts from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona (p = 0.702; η2 = 0.003). Furthermore, after conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of three years, there was no significant difference in spelling performance when compared with the control group (p = 0.369; η2 = 0.027). No significant difference in growth was found among the GAA students who experienced the technology intervention when compared to their performance during the prior year when they were taught by using the traditional methods of teaching vocabulary (p = 0.331). No difference was found for the GAA students in vocabulary when compared to their peers in other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona after the end of the first year of the technology implementation (p = 0.203; η2 = 0.014). After conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of two years, there was no significant difference in vocabulary performance when compared to their counterparts from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona (p = 0.572; η2 = 0.006). Furthermore, after conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of three years, there was no significant difference in vocabulary performance when compared with the control group (p = 0.134; η2 = 0.073). No significant group differences was found among the students who experienced the technology intervention when compared to their performance during the prior year, when they were taught using the traditional methods of teaching reading comprehension (p = 0.735). No difference was found for the GAA students in reading comprehension when compared to their peers in other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona after the end of the first year of the technology implementation (p = 0.362; η2 = 0.007 ). After conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of two years, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension performance when compared to their counterparts from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona (p = 0.181; η2 = 0.032). Furthermore, after conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of three years, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension performance when compared with the control group (p = 0.073; η2 = 0.103). Conclusions and Recommendations Based on the results from this study, the use of tablets and educational software did not provide statistical significant academic benefits to GAA students in the areas of spelling and reading comprehension. Although, when looking to the unadjusted means between the technology group in comparison with the control group, an increase in academic performance can be observed. Hence, the recommendation for future research to use a more sensitive instrument for measuring intervention effects than the standardized academic test used in this study (ITBS). That students at GAA, who were part of the technology group for three years, were not at a disadvantage academically in the areas of spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension when compared to the fifth- through eighth-grade students from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona provided valuable information regarding students’ academic performance when using tablets and educational software. These findings were consistent with several studies (ASCD &amp; OverDrive, 2016; Moon et al., 2017; Schoology, 2017; Wang, 2017). Furthermore, the implementation of immersive technology in the classroom concurs with educational and curricular trend of equipping students with 21st-Century skills (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2016; Federal Communications Commission, 2012; Gross, 2013; US Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology, 2010). In summary, further research could investigate the degree of student involvement, engagement, self-motivation, teachers’ perception toward technology, impact of technology instruction and the workforce, and satisfaction in classrooms when tablets and educational apps are implemented.

No significant group differences was found among the students who experienced the technology intervention when compared to their performance during the prior year, when they were taught using the traditional methods of teaching reading comprehension (p = 0.735). No difference was found for the GAA students in reading comprehension when compared to their peers in other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona after the end of the first year of the technology implementation (p = 0.362; η2 = 0.007 ). After conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of two years, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension performance when compared to their counterparts from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona (p = 0.181; η2 = 0.032). Furthermore, after conducting a repeated measures ANCOVA to track the experimental group of students at GAA over a period of three years, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension performance when compared with the control group (p = 0.073; η2 = 0.103). Conclusions and Recommendations Based on the results from this study, the use of tablets and educational software did not provide statistical significant academic benefits to GAA students in the areas of spelling and reading comprehension. Although, when looking to the unadjusted means between the technology group in comparison with the control group, an increase in academic performance can be observed. Hence, the recommendation for future research to use a more sensitive instrument for measuring intervention effects than the standardized academic test used in this study (ITBS). That students at GAA, who were part of the technology group for three years, were not at a disadvantage academically in the areas of spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension when compared to the fifth- through eighth-grade students from the other Seventh-day Adventist schools in Arizona provided valuable information regarding students’ academic performance when using tablets and educational software. These findings were consistent with several studies (ASCD &amp; OverDrive, 2016; Moon et al., 2017; Schoology, 2017; Wang, 2017). Furthermore, the implementation of immersive technology in the classroom concurs with educational and curricular trend of equipping students with 21st-Century skills (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2016; Federal Communications Commission, 2012; Gross, 2013; US Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology, 2010). In summary, further research could investigate the degree of student involvement, engagement, self-motivation, teachers’ perception toward technology, impact of technology instruction and the workforce, and satisfaction in classrooms when tablets and educational apps are implemented.

Instructional methods varied naturalistically across venues and instructors. Independent variables included testing condition (pre vs. post), course type (rank and major), focus of course content (specialization of content), prior teaching experience, and type of instructional implementation in the course. Dependent variables included quality of concept maps and quantity of concept map nodes and links. Mixed ANOVAs were used for statistical procedures. There were significant main effects of pre-topost conceptual change for all independent measures.

Conjoint analysis, which is a multivariate statistical method, was employed in this study. The prepared conjoint questionnaire was administered both to the entire research group and to visual, auditory and kinesthetic style learning student groups separately. The findings obtained were interpreted by matching with their learning styles. It was concluded that online learning students attached great importance to the employed technology characteristic and to the student—administrator interaction. Considering general of the students, the synchronization or asynchronization of mode of communication and the existence or non-existence of technical support in the prepared environment were not considered important. It was concluded that as the learning styles of students varied, their views about other variables, the interaction preferences in the online learning environment in particular, also differed. Learning styles of students and their preferences concerning the learning materials also showed a parallelism.", This study examines learning styles of students receiving education via online learning environments .

Physics plays a dominant role in spearheading technological advancement, promoting national wealth, improving health and accelerating industrialization. In Kenya, the overall students’ performance in physics at Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examination has been poor, with very low student enrollment. This situation has been aggravated by the expository approaches used by physics teachers, bringing the need for teachers to seek an alternative pedagogy.The computer is being used to assist in the teaching/learning process in many subject areas with promising results.This study aimed at finding out the effect of computer-based simulation module on students’ achievement in magnetic effect of an electric current. The study adopted Solomon-Four Quasi-Experimental Design which involved comparisons between two experimental and two control groups. Purposive sampling technique was used to select four County boys’ secondary schools in Nyeri County, which had computers, and were accessible to the researcher. The four schools were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Each school provided one Form Two class for study and a total of 170 students were involved. All the subjects were exposed to the same content of the magnetic effect of an electric current. However, the experimental groups were taught using Computer-Based Simulation module while the control groups were taught through regular teaching methods. Experimental group-I and control group II were pre-tested prior to the implementation of the Computer-Based Simulation module. After teaching for four weeks, all the four groups were post-tested using the Physics Achievement Test (PAT).This instrument, which was developed by the researcher, was validated by three experts and pilot tested before use. The reliability coefficient using K-R21 for PAT was 0.81. Data were analyzed using t-test, one way ANOVA and ANCOVA at a significance level of alpha equal to 0.05.

The aim of this study was to investigate preferred styles of learning and how these relate to e-learning environments both qualitatively and quantitatively. Three research cohorts were of interest in this research, and following extensive invitations to participate in the research, forty-five undergraduate e-learners, nine graduate e-learners, and twenty-eight educators working in e-learning environments participated. Participants completed two research instruments. Quantitative data was obtained from the learning styles instrument Index of Learning Styles (ILS) (Felder & Soloman, 1991, 1994). The ILS assesses variations in individual learning style preferences across four dimensions or domains: Information Processing (active to reflective learning preferences), Information Perception (sensing/factual to intuitive/theoretical learning preferences), Information Reception (visual to verbal learning preferences), and Information Understanding (sequential to global learning preferences). Participants also completed a survey questionnaire which gathered further quantitative data (demographic data) and qualitative feedback (extended openended responses of their self-perceptions of the impact of learning styles within their specific e-learning environment in addition to snapshots of the participant’s e-learning environment). In summary, the statistical analysis of the quantitative data discerned that a mild preference existed across all three cohorts for active learning environments. A moderately strong preference existed across all three cohorts for visual learning environments. A statistically significant difference, however, was recorded in the data between undergraduate e-learners and the other cohorts on the two remaining learning style domains. Undergraduate e-learners scored a mild preference towards sensing (or factual) learning environments, while graduate e-learners and e-educators both scored a moderate preference towards intuitive (or theoretical) learning design. Additionally, undergraduate e-learners scored a mild preference for sequentially-structures e-learning environments, while graduate e-learners and e-educators both scored a mild preference for global e-learning designs. The results of this study indicated that learning style preferences between graduate e-learners and educators were aligned. The qualitative responses provided rich data on the impact of learning styles within e-learning environments. These findings suggest that learning styles do appear to be a consideration for both learners and educators in terms of learning (from the e-learner’s perspective), and in relation to the conception, design, and creation of effective e-learning environments (from the educator’s perspective). It concludes that in e-learning environments, just as in any other educational context, style does matter, and that a one-size-fits-all approach to learning design is at best inappropriate.

,,,A Comparison of Learning Styles in an Introductory Electrical Systems Course,"The introductory electrical systems course is one of the first opportunities that engineering students have to apply fundamental knowledge of math and physics to practical problem solving and circuit analysis. Since few students have practical experience with electrical circuits the material can prove difficult to apply. Typically, electrical systems are diagramed as circuit models, and basic physics concepts are translated to visually applied circuit analysis techniques (e.g., mesh current method, and current divider methods). Given this methodology, our supposition is that visual learners would have an advantage. Our long term goal is to design the course and its associated laboratory exercises to be optimally geared towards students’ learning style in order to improve success. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between students’ learning style and course performance. The measure of student learning style will be the Felder Index of Learning Styles which is an instrument developed by Richard Felder, Linda K. Silverman and Barbara A. Solomon that identifies a student’s learning preferences over four dimensions (sequential/global, visual/verbal, intuitive/sensing, active/reflective).

,,,Engineering Students Learning Preferences in UNITEN: Comparative Study and Patterns of Learning Styles.,"Introduction In the era of post-capitalist knowledge society, paradigm shift in engineering education is unavoidable in response to the rapid changes in the global market environment that emphasize on the innovation efforts for competitive advantage. Many practitioners in the engineering industry look seriously into this issue and did propose for new paradigms of engineering education in response to the changes in today's increasingly knowledge driven environment. The details can be found in numerous research papers and reports (Chua, 2014; Froyd et al., 2012; Mistree et al., 2014; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, 2007; National Science Board, 2007; Prados, 1998; Rajala, 2012; Rosen, 2007; Wince-Smith, 2005). In order to further enhance the quality of teaching and learning in engineering education, the students preference in learning is an important factor that should raise the attention of the education practitioners. This referred to the learning styles of the students. Learning styles are defined as ""the characteristic cognitive, affective, and psychological behaviors that serve as relatively stable indicators of how learner perceives, interacts with, and responds to the learning environment""(Keefe, 1991, p. 4). As the engineering instructors, we should be aware that different students are comfortable with different learning styles (Felder & Brent, 2005). The understanding of students preferences may contribute to the adjustment of teaching strategies and the design of learning instructions that will better accommodate for students learning needs (Cavanagh & Coffin, 1994; Chen & Chiou, 2012; Graf, 2007; Graf et al., 2007; Noguera & Wageman, 2011; Pedrosa de Jesus et al., 2004). Overview of learning styles The research on learning styles has been active since four decades ago (Cassidy, 2004; Pedrosa de Jesus et al., 2004). There exist various definitions for learning styles. As refer by Campbell et al. (2003), learning styles is defined as a certain specified pattern of behavior according to which the individual approaches learning experience. While Felder and Spurlin (2005) defined learning styles as the different ways students take in and process information. Another popular definition for learning styles refers to individuals' characteristics and preferred ways of gathering, organizing and thinking about information (Fleming, 2005). As noted by Kolb (1983), learning styles are not fixed personality traits but rather one's adaptive orientation to learning. Felder and Spurlin (2005) shared similar view with Kolb by which they stressed that ""learning style profiles suggest behavioral tendencies rather than being infallible predictors of behavior"" (p. 104). Many of the researchers did agree that individuals may tend to have a preference for one or two learning styles over others and the preferences can be affected by a student's educational experience (Felder & Spurlin, 2005; Honey & Mumford, 1992; Kolb, 1983). Therefore, learning styles are ""relatively stable but are not immutable"" (Pedrosa de Jesus et al., 2004, p. 533). Throughout the learning process and based on different educational experience, the students may discover better way of learning and develop certain learning preferences. The learning style assessments can benefit both the instructors and students (Felder & Spurlin, 2005; Larkin-Hein & Budny, 2001). Thus, from the instructors' perspective, the identification of the students learning styles may lead to gain better understanding of learners with different learning styles.

,,,Who Are Our Students? A Multi-Assessment Approach to Characterizing an Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Student Population,"The current student population in higher education consists of a diverse and rapidly changing collection of individuals with different personalities, learning styles, values and backgrounds.

The existing preferences in learning styles of students of four areas of training have been studied by the Felder-Soloman Index of Learning Styles. Technology students have the most balanced learning profile: the preference of any style in all dimensions does not exceed 70%. Future chemists and pharmacists are characterised by the apparent preferences of visual, sensitive and active styles (at the level of 80%), as well as a moderate preference of sequential style (~70%). Design students exhibit distinct domination of visual style (>95%) over verbal one (<5%). In three other dimensions, a moderate preference (60-70%) of active, sensitive and sequential styles over reflective, intuitive and global styles is observed. Relative invariance of learning styles has been proved by the results of the survey for pharmacy students: the dominant styles are poorly changed during four years of undergraduate study. Increasing reflectivity, intuitiveness and verbality becomes significant for the fifth year of study. However, such changes may be related not so much to the transformation of personality characteristics, but are caused by the additional selection of students when they join their graduate school.

The purpose of this paper is to address the use of Honey and Mumford’s Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ) to investigate the learning style preferences of undergraduate students at the American University of Ras Al Khaimah (AURAK) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) culture. It also investigates whether there are significant differences across the four dimensions of learning styles due to students’ demographics.




Design/methodology/approach




Questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 200 undergraduate students at AURAK in the UAE. The majority of students were Arabic native-speakers. Descriptive statistics were used to present the main characteristics of respondents and the results of the study. The independent samples t-test, Mann–Whitney test and Kurskal–Wallis test were used to find out if there are significant differences across the four dimensions of learning styles due to students’ demographics.




Findings




The results of the study illustrated that undergraduate students at AURAK have preferences for the reflector (15.0), pragmatist (14.2), theorist (13.9) and activist (12.3) learning styles. Moreover, there are only significant differences between Emirati and non-Emirati students across the four learning styles and between single and married students in the theorist learning style.




Research limitations/implications




This study has a number of limitations. First, the findings of the study are based on the data collected from only one university.

,,,A Descriptive Study of Learning Style Diversity in Design and Innovation Teams,"Author(s): Lau, Kimberly | Advisor(s): Agogino, Alice M | Abstract: Design and innovation are increasingly important for attaining competitive advantage. This is achieved largely through the creation of meaningful customer experiences, and companies employing cross-functional teams are consistently reaching the best results. Designing these customer experiences requires teamwork that capitalizes on the diversity of the design team – whether gender, functional, disciplinary or cognitive. This research investigates the role of diversity in design teams, and in particular the role of cognitive diversity. It leverages David Kolb’s experiential learning theory and associated learning styles because they correlate well with the phases of the design process. It also considers factors such as gender, ethnicity, discipline, and job level.The first study explores the composition of innovation- or design-oriented populations in academic and corporate settings. Data was gathered from undergraduate-level and graduate-level students as well as from industry professionals in design, engineering, and consulting firms worldwide. The analysis draws comparisons among the international populations, across fields of expertise, and with other demographics to build a characterization of the design population. The findings show a surprising lack of diversity where it might be most expected. In particular, converging learners consistently dominate across all populations, highlighting an alarming absence of diverging learners in the design world.The second study explores the confidence levels in ABET skills and learning style preferences of students in project-based design courses. Results highlight national and gender differences in students’ perception of their development in ABET-related engineering and design skills. American students rated themselves higher in creativity, teamwork, ethics, facility with tools of engineering practice, and in recognizing global impact. Korean students assessed their skills higher in design, problem solving, and communication skills. However, the students follow similar gender patterns overall, where men reported more confidence in technical and analytical skills and women were more confident in communication and teamwork skills. The results also show behavioral trends that match the various learning styles. Accommodators self-rated highest in leadership and management skills, convergers self-ranked their analytical skills as strongest among all other skills, and assimilators perceive themselves as best in data processing. The third study explores the role of diversity in design team performance and presents results about how diversity factors affect the dynamics and success of a design team. Discipline and gender are also considered.

Lau,Kimberly Lau",,2015.0,"Author(s): Lau, Kimberly | Advisor(s): Agogino, Alice M | Abstract: Design and innovation are increasingly important for attaining competitive advantage. This is achieved largely through the creation of meaningful customer experiences, and companies employing cross-functional teams are consistently reaching the best results. Designing these customer experiences requires teamwork that capitalizes on the diversity of the design team – whether gender, functional, disciplinary or cognitive. This research investigates the role of diversity in design teams, and in particular the role of cognitive diversity. It leverages David Kolb’s experiential learning theory and associated learning styles because they correlate well with the phases of the design process. It also considers factors such as gender, ethnicity, discipline, and job level.The first study explores the composition of innovation- or design-oriented populations in academic and corporate settings. Data was gathered from undergraduate-level and graduate-level students as well as from industry professionals in design, engineering, and consulting firms worldwide. The analysis draws comparisons among the international populations, across fields of expertise, and with other demographics to build a characterization of the design population. The findings show a surprising lack of diversity where it might be most expected. In particular, converging learners consistently dominate across all populations, highlighting an alarming absence of diverging learners in the design world.The second study explores the confidence levels in ABET skills and learning style preferences of students in project-based design courses. Results highlight national and gender differences in students’ perception of their development in ABET-related engineering and design skills. American students rated themselves higher in creativity, teamwork, ethics, facility with tools of engineering practice, and in recognizing global impact. Korean students assessed their skills higher in design, problem solving, and communication skills. However, the students follow similar gender patterns overall, where men reported more confidence in technical and analytical skills and women were more confident in communication and teamwork skills. The results also show behavioral trends that match the various learning styles. Accommodators self-rated highest in leadership and management skills, convergers self-ranked their analytical skills as strongest among all other skills, and assimilators perceive themselves as best in data processing. The third study explores the role of diversity in design team performance and presents results about how diversity factors affect the dynamics and success of a design team. Discipline and gender are also considered. The data were gathered over two semesters of a multidisciplinary, project-based graduate level design course and captured through a series of surveys administered throughout the semester. Results offer insights into how students with different learning styles contribute differently to design team performance. The more diverse teams, as measured by the number of converging learners on the team, generally performed better than homogeneous teams, both in self-perceptions of team performance and by external reviews."," The more diverse teams, as measured by the number of converging learners on the team, generally performed better than homogeneous teams .

,,,An evaluation of the effectiveness of face-to-face versus e-learning in the UAE Civil Defence sector,"In the UAE, e-Learning has been adopted as a new learning mode to increase awareness and standards of building fire safety of it civil defence workforce. Training in this sector has been mainly based around traditional classroom approaches. This research specifically focuses on an online approach to delivering and sustaining the continuous professional development (CPD) of UAE fire fighters. The key aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of learning and performance between face-to-face learning and e-Learning. The central research question is: does learning effectiveness differ between traditional learning and e-Learning? This study employs a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the three different learning interventions: face-to-face learning, high media rich e-Learning and low media rich e-Learning. A survey method was selected to gather the data on learning effectiveness following the completion of the training programme from a sample of participants (n=412) professionally engaged in the civil defence sector. A key finding was that across all measures of learning effectiveness: engagement, cognitive performance and behavioural performance, scores in the face-to-face mode were significantly better than in the e-Learning mode. Furthermore learning effectiveness was found to be significantly better in high media rich than low media rich e-Learning design. The findings indicate that learning styles impacted on learning effectiveness between the three modes of learning. There was significant interaction between learning styles and learning mode on learning effectiveness. There were statistically significant differences in learning effectiveness for all learning styles. In 7 out of the 8 learning styles (Active, Reflective, Verbal, Visual, Sequential, Global, Sensing, Intuitive) learning effectiveness was higher on average in the face-to-face learning mode than in both of the e-Learning modes. The differences in terms of effect sizes varied between these learning styles. Only reflective learning exhibited a higher learning effectiveness score for high media rich e-Learning than face-to-face. Spatial ability did not have any statistically significant effect on learning effectiveness in the two learning approaches of traditional and e-Learning. However when comparing the two types of e-Learning high spatial ability learners performed less well in the low multimedia mode than in the high multimedia mode.  This research provides evidence to show that learning styles are significantly related to learning achievement in e-Learning and there are differential effects for different learning styles. The study also provides evidence that the use of rich multimedia is positively related to higher learning effectiveness. The findings contribute to empirical evidence for differences between face-to-face and e-learning and the role of media richness and learning styles.

10.1007/978-3-030-48190-2_7,,,Sequential Analysis of Online Learning Behaviors According to E-Learning Readiness,"An important advantage of e-learning environments is the numerical observation of the learning behaviors of learners. The use of e-learning environments by learners creates a learner data (log data). From these learner data, the navigation patterns obtained by using educational data mining have a very important in learning and teaching design. Studies have shown that learners’ learning behaviors in online learning environments may vary according to the characteristics of learners. Studies on the differentiation of the navigation patterns according to the psycho-educational characteristics of the learners provide very strong inputs to the design of the learning environment appropriate to the characteristics of the learners, which is named as adaptive learning environments. According to these inputs, learning environment designs can be developed according to the individual characteristics of the learners. Online learners’ readiness (OLR) for e-learning is an important psycho-educational structure. The aim of this study is to investigate learners’ navigations in the e-learning environment according to the level of readiness for e-learning. Self-directed learning, learner control, motivation sub-dimensions were used in this study as online readiness sub-dimensions. The consecutive analysis was used to reveal the model of human behavior and communication patterns.

The use of e-learning environments by learners creates a learner data (log data). From these learner data, the navigation patterns obtained by using educational data mining have a very important in learning and teaching design. Studies have shown that learners’ learning behaviors in online learning environments may vary according to the characteristics of learners. Studies on the differentiation of the navigation patterns according to the psycho-educational characteristics of the learners provide very strong inputs to the design of the learning environment appropriate to the characteristics of the learners, which is named as adaptive learning environments. According to these inputs, learning environment designs can be developed according to the individual characteristics of the learners. Online learners’ readiness (OLR) for e-learning is an important psycho-educational structure. The aim of this study is to investigate learners’ navigations in the e-learning environment according to the level of readiness for e-learning.

Mentors and mentees reported high levels of overall satisfaction with the program, at both of the evaluation time points. Participants spent less than 60 min/week each on mentoring activities.   Conclusions:  Both mentors and mentees benefited from the mentoring relationship.   RESUME    Contexte :  Le mentorat est associe a des resultats positifs sur le plan professionnel et personnel. Il existe toutefois peu de donnees sur des programmes de mentorat pour les pharmaciens.   Objectif :  Concevoir et evaluer un programme de mentorat pour les pharmaciens d'hopitaux mis sur pied au St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, a Hamilton, en Ontario, en determinant les avantages et les problemes connus des participants et si le programme a confere les competences necessaires a une relation de mentorat fonctionnelle.   Methodes :  Une etude pilote descriptive a ete menee entre juin 2007 et novembre 2008. Des groupes de discussion et des questionnaires autoadministres ont ete realises a deux moments (apres 3-4 mois et a la fin de l'etude). Les groupes de discussion etaient distincts pour les mentors et pour les mentores. Les donnees ont ete resumees selon des categories predefinies. Les donnees quantitatives issues des questionnaires ont ete resumees selon des medianes, des minimums et des maximums, et les donnees qualitatives degagees des enquetes ont ete transcrites et analysees.   Resultats :  Trois mentors ont ete chacun apparies avec un mentore. Les mentores ont defini en moyenne quatre objectifs d'apprentissage. Tous les mentores ont signale des ameliorations quant a leur perception de leur niveau de competence et d'habilete dans le cadre de leur relation de mentorat et quant a leur confiance dans leur capacite a executer les tâches d'un pharmacien d'hopital. Les mentors et les mentores etaient egalement plus satisfaits de leur travail. Les problemes signales etaient lies aux horaires et a la documentation. Les mentors et les mentores ont declare dans l'ensemble etre tres satisfaits du programme, aux deux moments d'evaluation. Chaque participant consacrait moins de 60 minutes par semaine a des activites de mentorat.   Conclusions :  Les mentors autant que les mentores ont beneficie de la relation de mentorat.", Mentoring is associated with positive professional and personal outcomes . There are few published data on mentoring programs for pharmacists . A descriptive pilot study was performed between June 2007 and November 2008 .

Method: A questionnaire survey was conducted at the end of the preparatory-year in Dammam University during the Orientation Week in April 2014. Interviews with some students and instructors were also conducted to triangulate the survey data. A semi-structured questionnaire was specially designed, checked for face validity and piloted in students. A chi-squared or   t   test was utilised to compare the programme selections and relevant variables with the significance level (  α  ) set at 0.05.     Results: A total of 74 pharmacy and 342 non-pharmacy candidates completed the questionnaire. Both groups mostly consisted of males aged 19 (60% – 70%) with the secondary school scores in the range of 96% - 100%. Almost all students could identify their strengths and weaknesses, especially in Chemistry, Physics and English. They felt stressed out and unhappy and needed some advice or counselling. Both contingents had similar motivation and career goals. Top three health-related programmes of choice were Dentistry, Medicine and Applied Medical Sciences. They claimed to have enough information to make a decision and preferred a one-to-one discussion with the programme instructors to get the programme information. Both groups had the same learning styles - ‘Director (or Converger)’ as a dominant (average score: 5.1 vs. 5.2) and ‘Producer (or Assimilator)’ as a secondary style (average score: 4.9 vs. 5.0).     Conclusion: The pharmacy and non-pharmacy candidates have similar perceptions, motivation and learning styles, but marginal differences were found in the programme selections and acquiring information.

,,,The development of PILS scoring system for the assessment of teaching techniques.,"Objectives: To determine learning-style scores of final-professional pharmacy students before and after various teaching experiences and to evaluate the relationships between scores and teaching practice variables. The outcome of study was aimed to determine better teaching experiences to improve learning skills. Method: The study was an observational cohort study design used for final professional pharmacy students. The Pharmacy inventory and learning style (PILS) model was employed for pre and post score after every teaching practice. Problemconstruction practice (PCP) technique was developed and analyzed against other teaching practices. Results: Research findings show significant increase in level of knowledge after each module of teaching the majority of students fall in high level of clinical knowledge with Problem-base learning (PBL) and Problem construction practice (PCP). Two domains of PILS (Enactor and Producers) significantly cross-over the other two domains with 17.6% and 5.9% of increase in post-result score. Findings also showed the increase characteristics of Enactor and Producers with PCP, compared with Producer and director in PBL practice. Conclusion: The external environment (teaching style) has influence on the individual student learning behavior. For effective learning a variety of techniques were employed for the identification of EPI (educational personnel intellectuality).

This is a uniquely stressful period of time for many learners; pharmacy education has shifted predominantly to novel online forms of teaching, learning, and assessment, and traditional psycho-social support became difficult to access due to lock-down and quarantine requirements.  
Methods: Data were gathered throughout May and June 2020 via participant-observer, semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was performed using deductive analysis techniques, based on existing themes in resilience research.  
Results: A total of 21 pharmacy students were interviewed, the majority of whom had ‘Assimilator’ or ‘Converger’ dominant learning styles as classified by Austin’s Pharmacists’ Inventory of Learning Styles (PILS). Assimilators had a stronger sense of professional identity, practiced positive psychology, and utilised journaling as resilience strategies more frequently than Convergers. Convergers were found to be more self-efficacious and adaptable than Assimilators.  
Conclusions: Rather than providing ‘one-size-fits-all’ advice and programming to pharmacy students, there may be potential to improve resilience by incorporating tailored and specific strategies based on the dominant learning style of each individual student.","Jacob Poirier,Jacob Poirier,Paul Gregory,Paul A.

Assimilators had a stronger sense of professional identity, practiced positive psychology, and utilised journaling as resilience strategies more frequently than Convergers. Convergers were found to be more self-efficacious and adaptable than Assimilators.  
Conclusions: Rather than providing ‘one-size-fits-all’ advice and programming to pharmacy students, there may be potential to improve resilience by incorporating tailored and specific strategies based on the dominant learning style of each individual student."," This study explored how differences in individual learning styles impacted personal resilience strategies among pharmacy students . Assimilators had a stronger sense of professional identity, practiced positive psychology, and utilised journaling as resilience strategies more frequently than Convergers ."

There are several opportunities and approaches to individualize a rotation.

The term learning styles is defined as “characteristic cognitive, affective, and psychological behaviors that serve as relatively stable indicators of how a learner perceives, interacts with, and responds to the learning environment.” 1 Although there may be some connection between learning styles and personality indices or emotional intelligence, instruments intended to describe personality traits or emotional intelligence should not be used to measure or characterize learning style.2 Although there are at least 70 different learning style schemes, an underlying tenet is the idea that different individuals learn and respond to information most effectively in different ways.3 In support of recognizing differences, proponents of the meshing hypothesis claim that instruction should be provided in the manner that “meshes” with the learner’s style.3 For example, one of the more well-known models of learning styles involves modality-specific preferences (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic).

We created prototype GDIs for drugs (risperidone, digoxin, warfarin, dimenhydrinate, cannabis) associated with serious ADEs among older adults.1, 2, 6 Our interdisciplinary team conducted literature reviews of each drug's pharmacology and prioritized relevant pharmacotherapeutic knowledge for inclusion based on a pilot survey.7 Graphic designers and clinicians created prototypes through a collaborative and iterative process. The design team applied principles of eye-tracking, visual hierarchy, and iconography to facilitate ease and speed of comprehension, then modified the prototypes based on clinician feedback (Figure 1). We conducted a RCT of nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physicians in Canada recruited through email between February 7 and August 8, 2019. Informed consent preceded the survey on Survey Monkey® (www.surveymonkey.com). We randomized participants using Survey Monkey®'s A/B Test function to an intervention group (infographics) or to a control group (usual pharmacotherapeutic resources). We obtained ethics approval from Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (4790) and registered with the ISRCTN Clinical Trials Registry (13433969). The primary outcome was the time required to complete a knowledge test, and secondary outcomes included the accuracy of knowledge and knowledge retention tests (Appendix S1). The knowledge retention test followed a demographic survey and the Health Professionals' Inventory of Learning Styles.8 We assessed reading experience and user-friendliness using 10-point Likert scales and open-ended questions.4 With an alpha of 0.05 and 80% power, a total sample of 34 individuals was required to detect a 10-minute difference to complete the knowledge test, deemed clinically important per pilot data.7 We used the t test to detect a difference in the primary outcome, and t test or Mann–Whitney U test for secondary outcomes. We conducted descriptive analyses of demographic statistics and reading experience and user-friendliness. We analyzed data using R software, version 4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We contacted 143 healthcare providers and received 50 (35.0%) responses (Figure S1). We randomized 22 participants in the infographic group, and 21 participants in the control group (Table S1). The control group reported using text-only primary and tertiary resources (e.g., Micromedex®, Lexicomp®). There was no statistically significant difference in the time required (45.1 minute; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6–84.7) with infographics compared with usual resources (20.0 minute; 95% CI 13.4–26.6) (p-value = 0.21). Participants using infographics answered more clinical questions correctly (60.0%; 95% CI 51.7–70.0%) compared to those in the usual resources group (35.0%; 95% CI 28.3–43.3) (Table S2, p-value <0.001), and had greater knowledge retention with infographics (78.0%; 95% CI 68.0–88.0%) versus usual resources (40.0%; 95% CI 30.0–50.0) (p-value <0.001). Overall, participants reported positive reading experiences with the infographics, and the majority found the information easy to follow and quick to retrieve (Table S3, Appendix S2). They appreciated the comprehensive yet concise, one-page format, pictorial elements, quantified risks and benefits, and prescribing information. Content-related and readability feedback included adding examples of major drug interactions, deprescribing recommendations, and simplifying and enlarging text. This is the first study describing the development and evaluation of infographics to facilitate clinician learning about pharmacotherapy for older adults. Combining text and graphic depictions of information stems from dual-coding and cognitive load theories and improve knowledge retention.9, 10 GDIs enhanced retrieval and retention of clinically relevant prescribing information compared to usual resources; however, the time required varied considerably, and may reflect the unfamiliarity with the novel infographics’ iconography, or the possibility of insufficient study power. With repeated use or explanatory aides (e.g., legend), the time required may decrease. Limitations include using clinical scenarios with multiple choice and very short answer questions rather than observing actual clinical practice due to feasibility. We were also unable to detect or prevent contamination between groups. Although we developed the GDIs and set the knowledge tests, they reflected real-world clinical questions, and were validated by external clinicians from multiple disciplines.

Methods Content validity was assessed and improved through a team of experts. After a thorough literature review and utilizing the Delphi technique, six domains were defined in the framework, with their respective competencies and behaviors. A cross-sectional study was then carried out from March to October 2022 using an online questionnaire created on Google Forms. The snowball technique was applied to reach community pharmacists across all the Lebanese governorates. Results The final sample included 512 community pharmacists. The construct validity of the framework was confirmed by factor analysis. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measures of sampling adequacy were satisfactory for all models ranging from 0.500 to 0.956 with a significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity ( P &lt; 0.001). The internal consistency of all competency domains was confirmed by Cronbach’s alpha, with values ranging from 0.803 to 0.953. All competencies were significantly correlated with their respective domains ( P &lt; 0.001), and all domains were significantly correlated with each other and with the framework ( P &lt; 0.001). The participants declared being competent in all domains relating to fundamental skills, safe and rational use of medicines, pharmacy management, professional skills, public health fundamentals, and emergency preparedness and response, with some exceptions, such as compounding, management, and emergency preparedness. A higher declared competency level was associated with having more experience and receiving more than 50 patients per day.

Zywno Ryerson University Abstract The paper presents results of an action research project, which took place between January and April 2001, and examined how differences in prior academic achievement of students and in their learning styles affected learning outcomes. All students received hypermedia instruction. The results show that hypermedia allowed previously lower-achieving students to improve their academic performance and therefore reduce the gap between them and their higher-achieving peers. The findings suggest that reducing the gap was a result of hypermedia instruction moderating differences in achievement between students with different learning modalities and accommodating a wider range of learning styles than conventional instruction. These findings were consistent with the previous 2000 study and with the 1999 pilot project, where students in the experimental group received hypermedia instruction, and their achievement was compared with the achievement of conventionally instructed students in the control group. Course website access patterns and a survey of student attitudes towards hypermedia instruction are also discussed. The findings support the use of learning styles as a guideline for incorporation of the hypermedia into the instructional design of the course. I.

10.2307/249008,,,"Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology","Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs.

The scores and profiles reveal thinking preferences in four different ways of thinking and “knowing”: A = analytical-logical-quantitative, B = sequential-organized-detailed, C = interpersonal-sensory-kinesthetic, and D = innovative-holistic-conceptual thinking. With the HBDI, we have a tool that can assess the effects of curriculum restructuring. Data from 1990–1993 fall freshmen classes and 1991–1994 spring senior classes have been evaluated, where the 1994 seniors are the first group for which freshmen data are available. Conclusions drawn from the results are: 1) Overall, there has been a shift from “plug-and-chug” quadrant B thinking to increased “creative” quadrant D thinking, because more students with strong quadrant D preferences are being developed and retained, primarily due to the new creative problem solving course. 2) Avoidance of quadrant C thinking (teamwork skills) is persisting and creates classroom climates that are uncomfortable for some students, a high percentage being females. Students are not developing the teamwork and interpersonal thinking skills demanded by industry. 3) A majority of students are still being cloned in the A-dominant profile of the faculty.

This report documents work from a project commissioned by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) to carry out an extensive review of research on post-16 learning styles, to evaluate the main models of learning styles, and to discuss the implications of learning styles for post-16 teaching and learning. The following research questions were addressed: What models of learning styles are influential and potentially influential? What empirical evidence is there to support the claims made for these models? What are the broad implications for pedagogy of these models? What empirical evidence is there that models of learning styles have an impact on students’ learning? The project identified the range of models that are available and influential or potentially influential in research and practice, located these models within identifiable ‘families’ of ideas about learning styles, evaluated the theories, claims and applications of these models, with a particular focus on evaluating the authors’ claims for reliability and validity, evaluated the claims made for the pedagogical implications of the selected models of learning styles, identified what gaps there are in current knowledge and what future research is needed in this area, and made recommendations and drew conclusions about the research field as a whole.

,,,C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning,"From the Publisher:
Classifier systems play a major role in machine learning and knowledge-based systems, and Ross Quinlan's work on ID3 and C4.5 is widely acknowledged to have made some of the most significant contributions to their development. This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation.

C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate.

Classifier systems play a major role in machine learning and knowledge-based systems, and Ross Quinlan's work on ID3 and C4.5 is widely acknowledged to have made some of the most significant contributions to their development. This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation.

C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate.

Mismatches often occur be- tween the learning styles of students in a language class and the teaching style of the instructor, with unfortunate effects on the quality of the students' learning and on their attitudes toward the class and the subject. This paper defines several dimensions of learning style thought to be particularly relevant to foreign and second language education, outlines ways in which certain learning styles are favored by the teaching styles of most language instructors, and suggests steps to address the educational needs of all students in foreign language classes. Students learn in many ways—by seeing and hearing; reflecting and acting; reasoning logi- cally and intuitively; memorizing and visualiz- ing. Teaching methods also vary. Some instructors lecture, others demonstrate or dis- cuss; some focus on rules and others on ex- amples; some emphasize memory and others understanding. How much a given student learns in a class is governed in part by that stu- dent's native ability and prior preparation but also by the compatibility of his or her charac- teristic approach to learning and the instructor's characteristic approach to teaching.

However, courses which adapt to the individual needs of students make learning easier for them and lead to a positive effect in learning. In this paper, we introduce a concept for providing adaptivity based on learning styles in LMS. In order to show the effectiveness of our approach, Moodle was extended by an add-on and an experiment with 437 students was performed. From the analysis of the students’ performance and behaviour in the course, we found out that students who learned from a course that matches their learning styles spent significantly less time in the course and achieved in average the same marks than students who got a course that either mismatched with their learning styles or included all available learning objects. Therefore, providing adaptive courses in LMS according to the proposed concept can be seen as effective in supporting students in learning.","Sabine Graf,Sabine Graf,K.

,,,The magical number seven plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information,"First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects.

,,,Toward a Theory of Instruction,"This country's most challenging writer on education presents here a distillation, for the general reader, of half a decade's research and reflection. His theme is dual: how children learn, and how they can best be helped to learn--how they can be brought to the fullest realization of their capacities. Mr. Bruner, ""Harper's"" reports, has ""stirred up more excitement than any educator since John Dewey."" His explorations into the nature of intellectual growth and its relation to theories of learning and methods of teaching have had a catalytic effect upon educational theory. In this new volume the subjects dealt with in ""The Process of Education"" are pursued further, probed more deeply, given concrete illustration and a broader context. ""One is struck by the absence of a theory of instruction as a guide to pedagogy,"" Mr. Bruner observes; ""in its place there is principally a body of maxims."" The eight essays in this volume, as varied in topic as they are unified in theme, are contributions toward the construction of such a theory. What is needed in that enterprise is, inter alia, ""the daring and freshness of hypotheses that do not take for granted as true what has merely become habitual,"" and these are amply evidenced here.

Mr. Bruner, ""Harper's"" reports, has ""stirred up more excitement than any educator since John Dewey."" His explorations into the nature of intellectual growth and its relation to theories of learning and methods of teaching have had a catalytic effect upon educational theory. In this new volume the subjects dealt with in ""The Process of Education"" are pursued further, probed more deeply, given concrete illustration and a broader context. ""One is struck by the absence of a theory of instruction as a guide to pedagogy,"" Mr. Bruner observes; ""in its place there is principally a body of maxims."" The eight essays in this volume, as varied in topic as they are unified in theme, are contributions toward the construction of such a theory. What is needed in that enterprise is, inter alia, ""the daring and freshness of hypotheses that do not take for granted as true what has merely become habitual,"" and these are amply evidenced here.

The process included professional and student inputs in special procedures for selecting scale items and designing criterion items. The utility of this approach is considered and problems critiqued.

10.2307/4447506,,,Hemispheric Preference: The Newest Element of Learning Style.,"T HE CASE FOR matching learning and teaching styles grows stronger every year. In the early seventies, it was verified that students could identify their own styles accurately (Domino 1970; Farr 1971) and, since then, many researchers have evidenced that both achievement and attitudes toward school improve significantly when instructional methods or resources complement the way individuals learn (Cafferty 1980; Carbo 1980; Copenhaver 1979; Douglass 1979; Krimsky 1981; Lynch 1981; Pizzo 1981; Trautman 1979; White 1981). Although learning style has been defined differently by various researchers (Dunn, et a/. 1981), it has been limited to selected environmental, emotional, sociological, physical, and psychological elements. Recently, a new element-hemispheric preferencewas proposed based on the differential efficiency of the two hemispheres (Zenhausern 1980). A Right-preferenced person appears to be more efficient at those tasks for which the right hemisphere is specialized; that individual would tend to think ""in pictures"" and would prefer deductive reasoning. A Left-preferenced person should be more efficient at left-hemisphere specializations, would tend to think ""in words,"" and would prefer inductive reasoning. Verification of that model has been found in the area of thinking style (Zenhausern and Repetti 1979), memory (Zenhausern and Gebhardt 1979), brain processing (Coleman and Zenhausern 1979) and maze learning (Zenhausern and Nickel 1979). There are many indications that hemispheric preference is an important learning style element. For example, a Right-preferenced teacher would tend to teach deductively-which would be ""backwards"" for Left-preferenced students; conversely, a Left-preferenced teacher would tend to teach inductively-the exact opposite way of ""making sense"" to Right-preferenced students. To determine whether relationships actually exist between selected elements of learning style and hemispheric preference, a study was conducted to compare the identified learning style characteristics of 353 high school students and their Left/Right dispositions.

An OrganitatiOn of Learning Styles Theory and ConstruCtS Introduction Lynn Curry, Ph.D. Division of CME Dalhousie University Halifax, NS In the past three years there has been a resurgence of interest in learning styles as applied to education generally and health professions education in particular. This interest stems from those with research interests in learning style(1,2), those charged with the responsibility for curriculum determination(3,4), and from those with political responsibility to insure the quality of initial training and continuing education(5). For all this activity there are difficulties presently preventing significant progress in application of learning styles to professional training and continuing education. Chief among these difficulties is the bewildering confusion of definitions surrounding learning style conceptualizations, and the concommitant wide variation in scale or scope of behaviour claimed to be predicted by learning style models. Some learning style conceptualization, for example, claim to predict only an individual's choice between a lecture style course versus a small group style course; others attempt to predict habitual procedure for all learning acts in which an individual might engage.

An OrganitatiOn of Learning Styles Theory and ConstruCtS Introduction Lynn Curry, Ph.D. Division of CME Dalhousie University Halifax, NS In the past three years there has been a resurgence of interest in learning styles as applied to education generally and health professions education in particular. This interest stems from those with research interests in learning style(1,2), those charged with the responsibility for curriculum determination(3,4), and from those with political responsibility to insure the quality of initial training and continuing education(5). For all this activity there are difficulties presently preventing significant progress in application of learning styles to professional training and continuing education. Chief among these difficulties is the bewildering confusion of definitions surrounding learning style conceptualizations, and the concommitant wide variation in scale or scope of behaviour claimed to be predicted by learning style models. Some learning style conceptualization, for example, claim to predict only an individual's choice between a lecture style course versus a small group style course; others attempt to predict habitual procedure for all learning acts in which an individual might engage. Needless to say the evidence gathered to support various conceptualizations varies radically in terms of psychometric standards. The organization described here attempts to bring some order to this chaos by proposing an empirically testable structure encompassing learning style concepts that have established psychometric standards."," An Organization of Learning Styles Theory and Constructs.

Why is it necessary to modify instructional practices based on the ""new"" concept? Will it enhance our effectiveness as teachers or will it just tie us down with more paperwork? Will it increase our students' learning and motivation or will it simply complicate what might be an otherwise smooth-running instructional program? In dealing with the concept of matching teaching and learning styles, these questions are of particular interest. We say this because over the past two decades a great deal of progress has been made toward recognizing the varying needs and characteristics of the learner. In fact, the concept of ""individualized instruction"" has become one of the cornerstones of modern educational practice.

Statistical analyses included a multivariate analysis of variance with 22 dependent variables (learning-style elements) and 2 between-subjects variables (gender and country) and a discriminant analysis. The alpha level was established at the p < .05 level. There were significant main effects for gender with medium effect sizes and statistically significant and large effect sizes for country main effects. There also were statistically significant and medium effect sizes for the interactions of country by gender. On the basis of these findings, the authors maintain that gender-based patterns of differences in learning styles are observable, and they encourage educators to consider all learners' learning-style strengths to maximize instructional outcomes.","Andrea Honigsfeld,Andrea Honigsfeld,Rita Dunn,Rita Dunn",Journal of Educational Research,2003.0,"Abstract The authors investigated gender differences among the learning styles of 1,637 adolescents from 5 countries—Bermuda, Brunei, Hungary, Sweden, and New Zealand.

,,,Supporting Teachers in Identifying Students' Learning Styles in Learning Management Systems: An Automatic Student Modelling Approach,"In learning management systems (LMSs), teachers have more difficulties to notice and know how individual students behave and learn in a course, compared to face-to-face education. Enabling teachers to know their students’ learning styles and making students aware of their own learning styles increases teachers’ and students’ understanding about the students’ learning process, allows teachers to provide better support for their students, and has therefore high potential to enhance teaching and learning. This paper proposes an automatic approach for identifying students’ learning styles in LMSs as well as a tool that supports teachers in applying this approach. The approach is based on inferring students’ learning styles from their behaviour in an online course and was developed for LMSs in general. It has been evaluated by a study with 127 students, comparing the results of the automatic approach with those of a learning style questionnaire. The evaluation yielded good results and demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles.

Though these so-called “neuromyths” are loosely based on scientific facts, they may have adverse effects on educational practice. The present study investigated the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among teachers in selected regions in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A large observational survey design was used to assess general knowledge of the brain and neuromyths. The sample comprised 242 primary and secondary school teachers who were interested in the neuroscience of learning. It would be of concern if neuromyths were found in this sample, as these teachers may want to use these incorrect interpretations of neuroscience findings in their teaching practice. Participants completed an online survey containing 32 statements about the brain and its influence on learning, of which 15 were neuromyths. Additional data was collected regarding background variables (e.g., age, sex, school type). Results showed that on average, teachers believed 49% of the neuromyths, particularly myths related to commercialized educational programs. Around 70% of the general knowledge statements were answered correctly. Teachers who read popular science magazines achieved higher scores on general knowledge questions. More general knowledge also predicted an increased belief in neuromyths. These findings suggest that teachers who are enthusiastic about the possible application of neuroscience findings in the classroom find it difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from scientific facts. Possessing greater general knowledge about the brain does not appear to protect teachers from believing in neuromyths. This demonstrates the need for enhanced interdisciplinary communication to reduce such misunderstandings in the future and establish a successful collaboration between neuroscience and education.","Sanne Dekker,Sanne Dekker,Nikki Lee,Nikki C.

Different lines of research are reviewed, show- ing that the self-efficacy mechanism may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to ac- count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur- suits.

This paper refines the concept of quality of e-learning systems and proposes a new framework, called TICS (Technology, Interaction, Content, Services), which focuses on the most important aspects to be considered when designing or evaluating an e-learning system. Our proposal emphasizes user-system interaction as one of such important aspects. Guidelines that address the TICS aspects and an evaluation methodology, called eLSE (e-Learning Systematic Evaluation) have been derived. eLSE methodology combines a specific inspection technique with user-testing. This inspection, called AT inspection, uses evaluation patterns, called Abstract Tasks (ATs), that precisely describe the activities to be performed during inspection. The results of an empirical validation of the AT inspection technique, carried out to validate this technique, have shown an advantage of the AT inspection over the other two usability evaluation methods, demonstrating that Abstract Tasks are effective and efficient tools to drive evaluators and improve their performance.","Rosa Lanzilotti,Rosa Lanzilotti,Carmelo Ardito,Carmelo Ardito,Maria Francesca Costabile,Maria Francesca Costabile,Antonella De Angeli,Antonella De Angeli",Educational Technology & Society,2006.0,"Quality of e-learning systems is one of the important topics that the researchers are investigating in the last years.

,,,Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World,"Practical Advice for Gamers by Jane McGonigal Reality is Broken explains the science behind why games are good for us--why they make us happier, more creative, more resilient, and better able to lead others in world-changing efforts. But some games are better for us than others, and there is too much of a good thing. Here are a few secrets that arent in the book to help you (or the gamer in your life) get the most positive impact from playing games. This practical advice--5 key quidelines, plus 2 quick rules--is scientifically backed, and it can be summed up in a single sentence: Play games you enjoy no more than 21 hours a week; face-to-face with friends and family as often as you can; and in co-operative or creator modes whenever possible. 1. Dont play more than 21 hours a week. Studies show that games benefit us mentally and emotionally when we play up to 3 hours a day, or 21 hours a week. (In extremely stressful circumstances--such as serving in the military during war-time--research shows that gamers can benefit from as many as 28 hours a week.) But for virtually everyone else, whenever you play more than 21 hours a week, the benefits of gaming start to decline sharply. By the time youre spending 40 hours or more a week playing games, the psychological benefits of playing games have disappeared entirely--and are replaced with negative impacts on your physical health, relationships, and real-life goals. So always strive to keep your gaming in the sweet spot: 721 hours a week. 2. Playing with real-life friends and family is better than playing alone all the time, or with strangers. Gaming strengthens your social bonds and builds trust, two key factors in any positive relationship. And the more positive relationships you have in real life, the happier, healthier and more successful you are. You can get mental and emotional benefits from single-player games, or by playing with strangers online--but to really unlock the power of games, its important to play them with people you really know and like as often as possible. A handy rule-of-thumb: try to make half of your gaming social. If you play 10 hours a week, try to play face-to-face with real-life friends or family for at least 5 of those hours. (And if youre not a gamer yourself--but you have a family member who plays games all the time, it would do you both good to play together--even if you think you dont like games!) 3. Playing face-to-face with friends and family beats playing with them online. If youre in the same physical space, youll supercharge both the positive emotional impacts and the social bonding. Many of the benefits of games are derived from the way they make us feel--and all positive emotions are heightened by face-to-face interaction. Plus, research shows that social ties are strengthened much more when we play games in the same room than when we play games together online. Multi-player games are great for this. But single-player works too! You can get all the same benefits by taking turns at a single-player game, helping and cheering each other on. 4. Cooperative gameplay, overall, has more benefits than competitive gameplay. Studies show that cooperative gameplay lifts our mood longer, and strengthens our friendships more, than competing against each other. Cooperative gameplay also makes us more likely to help someone in real life, and better collaborators at work--boosting our real-world likeability and chances for success. Competition has its place, too, of course--we learn to trust others more when we compete against them. But if we spend all our time competing with others, we miss out on the special benefits of co-op play. So when youre gaming with others, be sure to check to see if there are co-op missions or a co-op mode available. An hour of co-op a week goes a long way. (Find great co-op games for every platform, and a family-friendly list too, at Co-Optimus, the best online resource for co-op gaming.) 5. Creative games have special positive impacts. Many games encourage or even require players to design and create as part of the gameplay process--for example: Spore, Little Big Planet, and Minecraft; the Halo level designer and the Guitar Hero song creator. These games have been shown to build up players sense of creative agency--and they make us more likely to create something outside of the game. If you want to really build up your own creative powers, creative games are a great place to start. Of course, you can always take the next creative step--and start making your own games. If youve never made a game, its easier than you think--and there are some great books to help you get started. 2 Other Important Rules: * You can get all of the benefits of a good game without realistic violence--you (or your kids) dont have to play games with guns or gore. If you feel strongly about violence, look to games in other genres--theres no shortage of amazing sports, music, racing, puzzle, role-playing, casual, strategy and adventure games. *Any game that makes you feel bad is no longer a good game for you to play. This should be obvious, but sometimes we get so caught up in our games that we forget theyre supposed to be fun. If you find yourself feeling really upset when you lose a game, or if youre fighting with friends or strangers when you play--youre too invested. Switch to a different game for a while, a game that has lower stakes for you personally. Or, especially if you play with strangers online, you might find yourself surrounded by other players who say things that make you uncomfortable--or who just generally act like jerks. Their behavior will actually make it harder for you to get the positive benefits of games--so dont waste your time playing with a community that gets you down. Meanwhile, if you start to wonder if youre spending too much time on a particular game maybe youre starting to feel just a tiny bit addicted--keep track of your gaming hours for one week. Make sure they add up to less than 21 hours! And you may want to limit yourself to even fewer for a little while if youre feeling too much gamer regret.","Jane McGonigal,Jane McGonigal,Jane McGonigal",,2011.0,"Practical Advice for Gamers by Jane McGonigal Reality is Broken explains the science behind why games are good for us--why they make us happier, more creative, more resilient, and better able to lead others in world-changing efforts. But some games are better for us than others, and there is too much of a good thing. Here are a few secrets that arent in the book to help you (or the gamer in your life) get the most positive impact from playing games. This practical advice--5 key quidelines, plus 2 quick rules--is scientifically backed, and it can be summed up in a single sentence: Play games you enjoy no more than 21 hours a week; face-to-face with friends and family as often as you can; and in co-operative or creator modes whenever possible. 1. Dont play more than 21 hours a week. Studies show that games benefit us mentally and emotionally when we play up to 3 hours a day, or 21 hours a week. (In extremely stressful circumstances--such as serving in the military during war-time--research shows that gamers can benefit from as many as 28 hours a week.) But for virtually everyone else, whenever you play more than 21 hours a week, the benefits of gaming start to decline sharply. By the time youre spending 40 hours or more a week playing games, the psychological benefits of playing games have disappeared entirely--and are replaced with negative impacts on your physical health, relationships, and real-life goals. So always strive to keep your gaming in the sweet spot: 721 hours a week. 2. Playing with real-life friends and family is better than playing alone all the time, or with strangers. Gaming strengthens your social bonds and builds trust, two key factors in any positive relationship. And the more positive relationships you have in real life, the happier, healthier and more successful you are. You can get mental and emotional benefits from single-player games, or by playing with strangers online--but to really unlock the power of games, its important to play them with people you really know and like as often as possible.

,,,"Individual differences, hypermedia navigation, and learning: an empirical study","The learning behaviour and performance of 65 postgraduate students using a hypermedia-based tutorial were measured. Data were also obtained on cognitive style, levels of prior experience, motivation, age, and gender. A number of statistically significant interactions were found. Field-dependent/independent cognitive styles were linked to strategic differences in navigation. Levels of prior experience were linked to quantitative differences in both navigation behaviour and learning performance. The implications of these findings are discussed. The rapid rise in the use of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) in teaching and learning has brought hypermedia into prominence as a mode of information accessing. The term ""hypermedia"" signifies both mode and media of information presentation. Hypermedia may be distinguished from hypertext insofar as the former may include sound and/or moving images in addition to text. However, the research reported here focuses on the hyper element in that it is concerned not with particular media, but rather with users' navigation of the particular type of information structuring afforded by hypermedia. ""Hypermedia"" is used throughout this article as the more general term indicating information systems offering such structuring, regardless of whether they include media other than text. Hypermedia can facilitate relatively nonsequential access patterns as well as the relatively sequential patterns that are characteristic of print media, allowing a flexible range of design options to producers of learning materials. Increasingly, in learning environments in which students are expected to acquire information through hypermedia, students' ability to structure and manage their own navigation is becoming a required skill. The open and free browsing nature of hypermedia, whilst giving students the freedom to follow nonsequential, and potentially idiosyncratic, paths through a given body of subject content, at the same time places a premium on their ability to effectively exploit this freedom. This article presents the results of a research project that sought to explore the effects of individual differences on learners' navigation patterns and resultant learning outcomes. Background to the Research A number of researchers have theorised that hypermedia offers potential benefits to learning. The types of knowledge representation hypermedia affords are arguably closer than text-based representations to human associative and schema-based memory structures (Jonassen, 1988, 1992; Marchionini, 1988). It has been argued that in supporting such knowledge structures, hypermedia is well suited to facilitating learning processes, as proposed particularly by constructivist models (Cobb, Wood, Yackel, & McNeal, 1992; Jonassen, 1991; Nunes & Fowell, 1996). Jacobson and Spiro (1995) suggest that the transformation and reconstruction of information characterising deep learning is facilitated by hypermedia-based information presentation. A number of empirical studies have attempted to investigate such claims by comparing the learning effects of hypermedia and print-based text. Some main effects have been found in which superior learning performance was associated with hypermedia-based learning (Abrams & Streit, 1986; Borsook & Higginbotham-Wheat, 1992; Crosby & Stelovsky, 1994; Frey & Simonson, 1994; Liu & Reed, 1995; Nowaczyk & Snyder, 1993). Others, however, have found advantages for text (Gordon, Gustavel, Moore, & Hankey, 1988; Shneiderman, 1987; Riehm, 1996). The extent to which the non-linearity of hypermedia is suitable for all or the majority of students is open to question.

The group was divided into three groups: (a) those entering with no computer experience, (b) those entering with word processing experience, and (c) those entering with both word processing and programming language experience. It was found that the computer anxiety of the entire group reduced from pre- to post-treatment. Not only did the number of computer uses they listed at the onset increase—from 94 to 143, an increase of 52%—but also the types of uses departed from the early focus on isolated skills (via drill and practice) to the later domination of writing process uses. The changes in concerns of all students went from Awareness and Personal to Consequence, Collaboration, and Refocusing—changes that reflect concerns focusing less on self and more on their prospective students and fellow teachers.

We first describe the underlying premises of the theory and then show how the basic DCT mechanisms can be used to model diverse educational phenomena. The research demonstrates that concreteness, imagery, and verbal associative processes play major roles in various educational domains: the representation and comprehension of knowledge, learning and memory of school material, effective instruction, individual differences, achievement motivation and test anxiety, and the learning of motor skills. DCT also has important implications for the science and practice of educational psychology — specifically, for educational research and teacher education. We show not only that DCT provides a unified explanation for diverse topics in education, but also that its mechanistic framework accommodates theories cast in terms of strategies and other high-level psychological processes.
